  If You Encounter Issues

  Common Issues & Solutions

  1. "Ollama not responding"
  brew services restart ollama
  ./start-minimal.sh
  2. "No Java files found"
    - Verify path: /Users/thomaskamsker/Documents/Atom/vron.one/playground/java
    - Check if directory exists and contains .java files
  3. "Analysis taking too long"
    - This is normal for complex files (18+ complexity)
    - Each file can take 1-3 minutes for thorough analysis
    - You can interrupt (Ctrl+C) and still get partial results

  Monitor Progress

  # In another terminal, monitor Ollama
  ps aux | grep ollama

  # Check system resources  
  top -o cpu
