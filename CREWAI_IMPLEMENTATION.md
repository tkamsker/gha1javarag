# CrewAI Implementation Summary - IT17_6

## Overview

Successfully implemented CrewAI multi-agent requirements generation system as described in IT17_6.md. This improves step4_requirements.sh by using specialized AI agents to generate comprehensive requirements documents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- Added `crewai==0.203.1`
- Added `crewai-tools==0.1.0`

### 2. New Module (`src/synth/crewai_requirements.py`)
Created a comprehensive multi-agent system with:

#### **Agents:**
1. **Code Analyst** - Analyzes codebase structure, architecture patterns, backend components
2. **Dependency Analyst** - Examines build configurations, dependencies, integration points
3. **UI Flow Mapper** - Maps user interfaces, forms, navigation flows
4. **Technical Writer** - Synthesizes all analysis into structured requirements

#### **Tools:**
- **WeaviateSearchTool** - Enables agents to search and retrieve code artifacts from Weaviate vector database

#### **Features:**
- Multi-agent sequential processing
- Tool-enabled agents with Weaviate access
- Comprehensive context passing between agents
- Structured markdown output

### 3. CLI Integration (`src/cli.py`)
- Added `--use-crewai` flag to `requirements` command
- Enabled selection between CrewAI multi-agent and original per-artifact generation

### 4. Step4 Update (`step4_requirements.sh`)
- Modified Step 1 to use CrewAI by default
- Added information about multi-agent workflow

### 5. Bug Fixes (`src/synth/prd_markdown.py`)
- Fixed `TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'` in `_generate_navigation_structure()`
- Added proper handling for dict vs list data structures in GWT client artifacts

### 6. Data Loading Fix (`step4_requirements.sh`)
- Improved handling of nested dict/list structures in frontend artifacts
- Added type checking for gwt_client data

## How It Works

### Workflow:
1. **Input**: Project artifacts (DAO calls, JSP forms, backend docs, GWT UI, etc.)
2. **Code Analyst**: Uses Weaviate to search and analyze backend components
3. **Dependency Analyst**: Uses Weaviate to find integration points and dependencies
4. **UI Flow Mapper**: Uses Weaviate to map frontend interactions and forms
5. **Technical Writer**: Consolidates all analysis into structured requirements document
6. **Output**: Multiple markdown files with comprehensive requirements

### Example Usage:

```bash
# Run with CrewAI (default in step4)
./step4_requirements.sh

# Or use CLI directly
python main.py requirements --project YOUR_PROJECT --use-crewai

# Use original per-artifact generation
python main.py requirements --project YOUR_PROJECT
```

## Output Files

Generated files include:
- `{project}_crewai_requirements.md` - Main consolidated requirements
- `data/output/requirements/{project}/crewai/`:
  - `code_analysis.md` - Backend architecture analysis
  - `dependencies_analysis.md` - Dependencies and integrations
  - `ui_analysis.md` - UI flow mapping
  - `final_requirements.md` - Complete requirements document

## Technical Details

### LLM Configuration
- Uses Ollama with model from settings (default: `llama3.1:8b`)
- Base URL: `http://localhost:11434`
- Temperature: 0.7

### Weaviate Integration
- Agents can search across multiple artifact types:
  - BackendDoc, DaoCall, JspForm, IbatisStatement, DbTable
  - GwtModule, GwtUiBinder, GwtActivityPlace, JsArtifact
- Searches return context for informed analysis

### Error Handling
- Fixed import errors with correct CrewAI API usage
- Added proper type checking for data structures
- Improved error messages and fallbacks

## Benefits

1. **Specialized Analysis**: Each agent focuses on specific domain expertise
2. **Context-Aware**: Uses Weaviate to retrieve relevant code artifacts
3. **Structured Output**: Well-organized requirements documents
4. **Traceability**: Links requirements back to source artifacts
5. **Flexibility**: Can switch between CrewAI and original generation

## Known Limitations

1. Ollama context limits may require tuning for very large codebases
2. Multi-agent approach adds overhead compared to single-prompt generation
3. Requires Weaviate to be populated with indexed artifacts

## Future Enhancements

- Add parallel agent execution where appropriate
- Implement agent memory for consistency across sessions
- Add more specialized agents (Security Analyst, Performance Analyst)
- Improve tool descriptions and agent coordination

## Testing

Test script created: `test_crewai_requirements.py`
- Loads sample artifacts
- Tests complete generation workflow
- Verifies output file creation

## Status

âœ… All tasks completed
- CrewAI integration
- Multi-agent implementation
- Weaviate tools
- CLI integration
- Bug fixes
- Documentation

Ready for testing with real project data.
