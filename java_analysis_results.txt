# Technical Specifications and Documentation

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview
The application is structured around two primary UI components: `DetailsDefaultProductNodeView` and `SummaryPanel`. These components interact to manage and display product details and summaries.

### 1.2 Major Classes
- **DetailsDefaultProductNodeView**
  - **Description**: Manages the display of product details and contains multiple `FlapMenuItem` objects.
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Initialize UI components.
    - Maintain a list of `FlapMenuItem`.
    - Provide methods to add menu items and display product details.

- **SummaryPanel**
  - **Description**: Summarizes product details using various shared components.
  - **Responsibilities**:
    - Compile and display summarized information of products.
    - Maintain a list of shared components.
    - Provide methods to add components and summarize details.

### 1.3 Class Relationships
- `DetailsDefaultProductNodeView` contains multiple `FlapMenuItem` objects which manage UI interactions related to product details.
- `SummaryPanel` uses `SharedComponent` objects to integrate business and security options into product summaries.

## 2. Design Patterns
- **MVC Pattern**: The architecture leverages the MVC design pattern, where the `DetailsDefaultProductNodeView` and `SummaryPanel` act as controllers handling user interactions and updating the UI.
- **Factory Pattern**: Utilized for creating instances of various `MenuItem` subclasses effectively through dedicated constructors.

## 3. Method Hierarchies and Dependencies
### 3.1 Key Methods
- **DetailsDefaultProductNodeView**
  - `public void addFlapMenuItem(FlapMenuItem item)`: Adds a new flap menu item to the view.
  - `public void displayProductDetails()`: Handles the logic to render product details to the UI.

- **SummaryPanel**
  - `public void summarizeProductDetails()`: Compiles and presents product summaries.
  - `public void addSharedComponent(SharedComponent component)`: Adds a new shared component for enhanced UI functionality.

### 3.2 Dependencies
- Dependencies are established between the UI components through method calls and data sharing, ensuring modular interaction based on user input.

## 4. Improvements Suggested
- **Decompose Large Classes**: The `DetailsDefaultProductNodeView` and `SummaryPanel` classes should be split into smaller classes, each focusing on specific functionalities to enhance maintainability.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Review the responsibilities of the classes to ensure they adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle. Each class should encapsulate only one aspect of the UI or business logic.
- **Enhance Modularization**: Improve the separation of UI logic from business logic to make the code cleaner and easier to manage.

## 5. API Documentation
### 5.1 Public API Endpoints
- **POST /addFlapMenuItem**
  - **Description**: Adds a new item to the `DetailsDefaultProductNodeView`.
  - **Input**: JSON object representing the `FlapMenuItem`.
  
- **GET /displayProductDetails**
  - **Description**: Displays the full details of a selected product.

- **POST /summarizeProductDetails**
  - **Description**: Summarizes product information displayed in the `SummaryPanel`.
  
### 5.2 Method Signatures
```java
public void addFlapMenuItem(FlapMenuItem item);
public void displayProductDetails();
public void summarizeProductDetails();
public void addSharedComponent(SharedComponent component);
```

## 6. Implementation Guidelines
1. Follow the MVC pattern when adding new UI components.
2. Use factory methods when creating instances of menu items.
3. Regularly refactor code to maintain modularity and readability as new features are implemented.
4. Document any new methods and endpoints added to ensure clarity and ease of use for future developers.
