iteration 5: Requirements Extraction & Structuring Using clusters_by_class

**Goal**

To extract, group, and structure system requirements for the legacy Java/ASP/Oracle application by leveraging:

Doxygen XML parsing (already implemented)
Chroma DB embeddings (already implemented)
Grouping of requirements using clusters_by_class
Outputting a requirements document ready for future development
Directory Context
Location: /semantic
Relevant Files:
read_doxygen.py — parses Doxygen XML
embed_chroma.py — processes Chroma DB embeddings
clusters_by_class.json — provides class-based clustering for grouping requirements

**Tasks**

1. Load and Parse Artifacts
 Doxygen XML: Use read_doxygen.py to extract class, method, and file documentation.
 Chroma DB: Use embed_chroma.py to retrieve embedded business rules and data flows.
 Class Clusters: Load clusters_by_class.json to identify logical groupings of code artifacts.

2. Group Requirements by Class Cluster
 For each cluster in clusters_by_class.json:
Aggregate all related source files (Java, JSP, SQL, XML, JS).
Extract functional and business requirements from comments, method names, and Chroma DB embeddings.
Identify data model entities used within the cluster.

3. Draft Requirements per Cluster
 For each cluster, create a requirements section with:
Cluster Name/ID
Description of Functionality (based on Doxygen and Chroma DB)
Functional Requirements (FR-CLUSTER-XX)
Data Model Entities
Business Rules
Source File References
Example Section

## Cluster: OrderProcessing

**Description:** Handles all order-related operations, from cart management to order submission.

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-ORDER-01:** Users can add items to their cart.  
  _Source: CartController.java, cart.jsp_
- **FR-ORDER-02:** Orders can be submitted and validated.  
  _Source: OrderServlet.java, orders table_

### Data Model Entities
- **Order**
- **CartItem**

### Business Rules
- Orders must have at least one item.
- Only authenticated users can place orders.

### Source Files
- CartController.java
- OrderServlet.java
- cart.jsp

4. Assemble the Requirements Document
 Combine all cluster-based sections into a single Markdown requirements document.
 Add a Traceability Matrix at the end, mapping requirements to source files and classes.
5. Review & Refine
 Manually review each cluster section for completeness and clarity.
 Ensure all major modules and features are represented.
 Validate that every requirement is traceable to at least one source artifact.
Deliverables
requirements_by_cluster.md — Main requirements document, grouped by class clusters.
traceability_matrix.md — Matrix mapping requirements to code artifacts.
