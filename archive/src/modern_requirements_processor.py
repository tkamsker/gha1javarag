### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: 95% of API calls under 200ms
- **Throughput**: Support 10,000 concurrent users
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with zero-downtime deployments
- **Scalability**: Auto-scale from 10 to 1000+ instances

### Security Requirements
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication required
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- **Network Security**: TLS 1.3 for all communications

### Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR**: Full compliance with European data protection
- **SOC 2**: Security controls for service organizations
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards
- **Telecom Regulations**: Austria and EU telecommunications compliance

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Migration Complexity**: Large-scale data transformation
2. **Integration Challenges**: Multiple external system dependencies
3. **Performance Impact**: Potential performance degradation during migration
4. **User Adoption**: Change management and training requirements

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Phased Approach**: Incremental migration with validation
2. **Parallel Operations**: Run legacy and modern systems in parallel
3. **Extensive Testing**: Comprehensive testing at all levels
4. **User Training**: Comprehensive training and support programs

## Success Metrics and KPIs
