```

### Enhanced Workflow
```bash
./Step1_Enhanced.sh production    # AI-enhanced architectural analysis
./Step2_Enhanced.sh production    # Layer-aware requirements with context
./Step3_Enhanced.sh production    # Comprehensive cloud modernization
```

3. **Review architecture report** - Validates layer classification accuracy
4. **Check enhanced index files** - Provides navigation and overview
5. **Combine with web interface** - Enhanced search capabilities

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Run Enhanced Step1** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   ./Step1_Enhanced.sh production
   ```

2. **Generate Enhanced Requirements**:
   ```bash
   ./Step2_Enhanced.sh production
   ```

3. **Create Modernization Plan**:
   ```bash
   ./Step3_Enhanced.sh production
   ```

4. **Review Results**:
   - Check `requirements_enhanced/` for organized documentation
   - Review `enhanced_modern_requirements.md` for modernization plan
   - Examine `cloud_architecture_blueprints.json` for technical details

The enhanced workflow provides comprehensive, architecturally-aware analysis that significantly improves the quality and organization of requirements documentation and modernization planning.
