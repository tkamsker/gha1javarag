# Microservices Architecture Requirements for A1 CuCo System

## 1. Service Decomposition Strategy

### Domain-driven Service Boundaries
Based on the identified business domains, the following microservices should be created:

**Customer Management Service**
- Responsible for customer profiles, authentication, authorization, and personal data
- Manages customer lifecycle from registration to deactivation
- Handles customer preferences and communication settings

**Product Catalog Service**
- Maintains product definitions, pricing, availability, and inventory information
- Manages product categories, attributes, and relationships
- Provides product search and discovery capabilities

**Order Management Service**
- Processes customer orders, order status tracking, and fulfillment workflows
- Handles order creation, modification, cancellation, and history
- Integrates with inventory and billing systems

**Billing Service**
- Manages billing cycles, invoices, payment processing, and financial transactions
- Handles subscription management and recurring billing operations
- Provides billing reports and reconciliation capabilities

**Support Service**
- Manages customer support tickets, escalations, and service requests
- Handles knowledge base content and self-service portals
- Implements support workflow automation and routing

**Network Management Service**
- Controls network resources allocation and configuration
- Manages connectivity services and bandwidth provisioning
- Handles network monitoring and performance metrics

### Business Capability Alignment
Each microservice aligns with specific business capabilities:
- **Customer Management**: Identity management, customer onboarding, profile maintenance
- **Product Catalog**: Product definition, pricing strategy, inventory control
- **Order Processing**: Order fulfillment, workflow management, customer communication
- **Billing Operations**: Revenue recognition, payment processing, financial reporting
- **Support Services**: Customer service, issue resolution, knowledge management
- **Network Operations**: Infrastructure provisioning, resource management, connectivity

### Service Sizing and Scope
**Customer Management Service**: 10-15% of total system functionality
**Product Catalog Service**: 20-25% of total system functionality  
**Order Management Service**: 25-30% of total system functionality
**Billing Service**: 20-25% of total system functionality
**Support Service**: 10-15% of total system functionality
**Network Management Service**: 10-15% of total system functionality

### Data Ownership Principles
Each service owns its data domain:
- Customer Service: Customer profiles, authentication data, preferences
- Product Catalog: Product definitions, pricing rules, inventory levels
- Order Service: Order records, status information, fulfillment details
- Billing Service: Financial transactions, invoices, payment records
- Support Service: Ticket history, knowledge base articles, support interactions
- Network Service: Network configuration, resource allocation, connectivity data

## 2. Microservice Design Patterns

### API-first Design Principles
- All services expose RESTful APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- APIs designed with versioning in mind from inception
- Comprehensive API contracts defined before implementation
- Services implement proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- API gateway handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication and rate limiting

### Event-driven Architecture
- **Event Streams**: Kafka or RabbitMQ for message queuing
- **Event Sourcing**: Critical business events stored as immutable records
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separate read and write models for complex queries
- **Eventual Consistency**: Services communicate through asynchronous events
- **Domain Events**: Business events trigger downstream service operations

### Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions
**Order Processing Saga**:
1. Order Service creates order
2. Product Catalog Service validates inventory
3. Billing Service processes payment
4. Network Service provisions resources
5. Support Service creates ticket if needed

**Compensation Logic**:
- Each step has rollback capability
- Events are published for compensation actions
- Saga orchestrator manages transaction state and coordination

### Circuit Breaker and Retry Mechanisms
- **Circuit Breaker**: Netflix Hystrix or Resilience4j implementation
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout per service call
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolated thread pools for service calls
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable

## 3. Service Communication Requirements

### Synchronous Communication (REST, GraphQL)
**REST APIs**:
- Standard HTTP/HTTPS communication
- JSON payload format with proper content negotiation
- Rate limiting and authentication at API gateway level
- Service-to-service calls using service discovery

**GraphQL**:
- For complex customer data queries
- Client-side schema definition for flexible data fetching
- Field-level authorization controls
- Real-time subscriptions for critical updates

### Asynchronous Messaging (Event Streaming)
**Message Broker**: Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis
**Event Types**:
- OrderCreated, OrderUpdated, OrderCancelled
- PaymentProcessed, InvoiceGenerated
- CustomerRegistered, CustomerUpdated
- NetworkProvisioned, ResourceAllocated

**Messaging Patterns**:
- Publish/Subscribe for event distribution
- Dead letter queues for failed messages
- Message deduplication and ordering guarantees
- Event-driven workflows through message routing

### Service Discovery Mechanisms
**Service Registry**: Consul or Eureka
**Discovery Methods**:
- Client-side discovery with load balancing
- Server-side discovery through API gateway
- Health check endpoints for automatic service registration
- Dynamic service scaling based on discovery metrics

### API Versioning Strategies
**Versioning by URL Path**: `/api/v1/customers`
**Versioning by Header**: `Accept: application/vnd.a1.cuco.v1+json`
**Versioning by Media Type**: `Content-Type: application/vnd.a1.cuco.v1+json`
**Backward Compatibility**: Maintain 2 major versions for backward compatibility
**Deprecation Strategy**: 6-month deprecation timeline with migration guides

## 4. Data Management in Microservices

### Database per Service Pattern
**Customer Service**: PostgreSQL with customer data and authentication tables
**Product Catalog Service**: MongoDB for flexible product schema and indexing
**Order Service**: PostgreSQL with order transactional data and relationships
**Billing Service**: Oracle or MySQL for financial transaction integrity
**Support Service**: PostgreSQL for ticket history and support workflows
**Network Service**: Redis for caching network state and configuration data

### Event Sourcing Requirements
- **Event Store**: Dedicated event store database (e.g., EventStoreDB)
- **Event Versioning**: Events stored with version numbers for backward compatibility
- **Projection Management**: Real-time projections for read models
- **Snapshot Strategy**: Periodic snapshots to optimize event replay performance
- **Event Replay**: Capability to replay events for debugging and analytics

### CQRS Implementation
**Command Side**:
- Order Service handles order creation and modifications
- Billing Service processes financial commands
- Network Service manages resource allocation commands

**Query Side**:
- Customer Service provides customer read models
- Product Catalog Service offers product search read models
- Support Service delivers ticket status read models

### Data Consistency Patterns
**Eventual Consistency**: For non-critical data synchronization
**Saga Pattern**: For business transaction consistency across services
**Read Replicas**: For performance optimization in read-heavy operations
**Distributed Transactions**: Using Saga pattern for critical workflows
**Cache Invalidation**: Automated cache invalidation on data changes

## 5. Service Mesh Integration

### Inter-service Communication Security

- **Health-based Routing**: Dynamic routing based on service health status

### Service Resilience Patterns
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolated circuit breakers for each service dependency
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts with fallback mechanisms
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures through service isolation
- **Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry with backoff strategies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced functionality during partial outages

## 6. Testing Strategies
