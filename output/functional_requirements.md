# Functional Requirements

## Overview
This section describes the functional requirements of the system, organized by feature categories.


### USERMANAGEMENT Requirements

| Feature ID | Title | Description | Priority |
|------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| FR-UserManagement-001 | Comprehensive User and Administrator Account Management | The system shall provide functionality to register and login both normal users and administrators, as well as add and update various roles including doctors, patients, receptionists, and workers. The solution will support secure credential management, role assignment, and user information updates to ensure effective access control and personnel data integrity in the healthcare system. | High |
| FR-UserManagement-001 | Unified User Management Operations (Add, Update, Login, Register) for Admin and General Users | The system shall provide secure and unified endpoints for adding and updating healthcare users (doctors, patients, receptionists, workers), and for registering and authenticating both admin and general users. All operations must be handled via HTTP POST methods in the Controller class, ensuring data validation, role-appropriate access control, and consistent error handling. | High |

#### FR-UserManagement-001: Comprehensive User and Administrator Account Management

**Description:** The system shall provide functionality to register and login both normal users and administrators, as well as add and update various roles including doctors, patients, receptionists, and workers. The solution will support secure credential management, role assignment, and user information updates to ensure effective access control and personnel data integrity in the healthcare system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system allows new users and administrators to register with required information and validations.
- The system authenticates users and administrators via separate login interfaces with secure credential checks.
- Authorized personnel can add new doctors, patients, receptionists, and workers by submitting required data through corresponding controller endpoints.
- Patient information can be updated by authorized users through the updatePatient interface, with appropriate field validations and audit trails.
- All role assignments and account creations trigger confirmation messages and provide error messages on failure (e.g., duplicate usernames or invalid data).
- All endpoints enforce authentication and authorization based on user role before allowing role-specific data operations.

**Dependencies:**
- FR-Auth-001: Secure Authentication Implementation
- FR-Data-Validation-002: Robust Input Validation for User Data
- FR-Roles-001: User Role and Permission Management

#### FR-UserManagement-001: Unified User Management Operations (Add, Update, Login, Register) for Admin and General Users

**Description:** The system shall provide secure and unified endpoints for adding and updating healthcare users (doctors, patients, receptionists, workers), and for registering and authenticating both admin and general users. All operations must be handled via HTTP POST methods in the Controller class, ensuring data validation, role-appropriate access control, and consistent error handling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All user addition (Doctor, Patient, Receptionist, Worker) operations use POST methods and validate input data for required fields and formats.
- Admin registration and login via POST are accessible only to unauthenticated users; authentication tokens are issued upon success.
- User registration and login via POST are available for general users and require unique identifiers for new accounts.
- Updating patient records is possible only for authenticated users with sufficient privileges.
- All endpoints respond with standardized success or error messages, with meaningful error details on failure (e.g., validation errors, authentication failure).
- Duplicate entries (e.g., existing user registration) are properly detected and rejected with an appropriate message.
- Session management and redirection are handled as per authentication state.
- All operations comply with applicable data privacy and security standards (e.g., password hashing, input sanitization).

**Dependencies:**
- FR-UserRoles-001 (User Roles and Permissions Management)
- FR-DataValidation-001 (Data Input Validation Framework)
- FR-SessionAuth-001 (Session and Authentication Middleware)
