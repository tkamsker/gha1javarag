      Represents the `user` action or method within the `AdminLogin` controller, serving
      as a central component for administrative user authentication workflows. This
      code element is responsible for securely handling incoming login requests from
      potential admin users. It validates submitted credentials against stored authentication
      data using established security measures such as password hashing and input
      sanitization to mitigate security risks. Upon successful verification, it initiates
      administrative user sessions, assigns appropriate roles and permissions, and
      provides access to privileged administrative features. In cases of invalid credentials
      or suspicious activity, it triggers error messaging, logs security events, and
      enforces access restrictions. Overall, this method ensures that only authorized
