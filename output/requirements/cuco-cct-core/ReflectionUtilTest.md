# Requirements Analysis: cuco-cct-core/src/test/java/at/a1ta/cuco/cct/util/ReflectionUtilTest.java

Here's the requirements analysis for the ReflectionUtilTest file:

1. Purpose and Functionality
- Test class for validating ETGT (appears to be a telecom/mobile subscription entity) data structure
- Verifies proper initialization and data integrity of various subscription components
- Focuses on validation of required fields and business objects

2. Data Handling
- Validates multiple data sections:
  * General section (customer data, bank account, billing, identification)
  * Tariff and bundle section (SIM, contract details, payments)
  * Mobile subscription configuration (hardware, porting, MSISDN)
- Ensures non-null values for critical fields
- Validates selectable options for tariff changes and MSISDN porting

3. Business Rules
- Mandatory fields include:
  * Customer identification and contact information
  * Banking and billing details
  * Contract configuration (renewal, payment terms)
  * Tariff and bundle specifications
- Contract-related validations:
  * Auto-renewal settings
  * Minimum contract period
  * Partial payment options
  * Hardware on receipt status

4. Dependencies and Relationships
- Relies on ETGT data model
- Integrates with mobile subscription configuration
- References custom assertion utilities
- Part of a larger customer contract/subscription management system

5. Technical Requirements
- Java-based test implementation
- Uses assertion framework for validation
- Implements reflection utilities for object inspection
- Requires proper initialization of all referenced objects

This appears to be part of a telecom subscription management system with focus on contract and service configuration validation.
