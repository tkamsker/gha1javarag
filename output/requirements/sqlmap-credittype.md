1. Purpose: Manages credit type definitions and operations

2. User interactions:
- Supports credit type management
- Handles credit type lookups and validations

3. Data handling:
- Maps CreditType DTO to database structure
- Implements caching for credit type data
- Uses EhCache for performance optimization

4. Business rules:
- Defines credit type classifications
- Manages credit-related business logic
- Implements read-only caching for reference data

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on sqlmap-config.xml
- Uses CreditType DTO class
- Requires EhCache implementation
- Author attribution indicates maintenance responsibility

Common themes across files:
- All use iBatis SQL mapping framework
- Implement DTO pattern for data transfer
- Follow similar configuration structure
- Use caching strategies for performance
- Part of larger core module (cuco-core)
