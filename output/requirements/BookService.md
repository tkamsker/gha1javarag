# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/com/bittercode/service/BookService.java

src/main/java/com/bittercode/service/BookService.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `BookService` interface defines the contract for managing book-related operations. It specifies methods to retrieve books by ID, get all books, and fetch multiple books using comma-separated IDs.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- No direct user interaction; this is an interface meant to be implemented by service classes handling book data.

### 3. Data Handling
- Manages `Book` objects.
- Throws `StoreException` for error handling in book operations.

### 4. Business Rules
- Ensures proper exception handling for invalid operations or database errors.
- Methods must validate inputs and handle potential exceptions from underlying implementations.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Depends on the `Book` model class.
- Relies on `StoreException` for error reporting.
