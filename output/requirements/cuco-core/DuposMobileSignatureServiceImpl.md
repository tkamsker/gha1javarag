# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/impl/DuposMobileSignatureServiceImpl.java

Requirements Analysis for DuposMobileSignatureService

1. Purpose and Functionality
- Primary purpose appears to be handling mobile digital signatures for contracts
- Implements contract signing functionality using DUPOS mobile signature system
- Facilitates sending contracts for digital signing

2. User Interactions
- No direct user interface components visible
- Service likely interfaces with other systems to process signature requests
- Appears to be a backend service component

3. Data Handling
- Processes contract documents for signing
- Handles file data through FilesType structure
- Manages signature method types via SignMethodType
- Processes response data through SendContractToSignResponseDocument

4. Business Rules
- Must support specific signature methods defined in SignMethodType
- Requires proper contract document formatting for signing
- Likely implements validation and verification of signature requests
- Must handle both sending and receiving of contract documents

5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Depends on Telekom EAI schema components
- Integrates with DUPOS mobile signature platform
- Core dependencies:
  * at.telekom.eai.schemas.eai.duposmobilesignature package
  * Contract handling components
  * Signature processing systems

Additional Notes:
- Implementation appears to be part of a larger contract management system
- Service likely requires secure communication channels
- Should include error handling for signature process failures
