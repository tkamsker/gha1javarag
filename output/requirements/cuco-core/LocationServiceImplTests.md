# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/test/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/impl/LocationServiceImplTests.java

Requirements Analysis for LocationServiceImpl:

1. Purpose and Functionality
- Test file for a Location Service implementation
- Appears to be part of a core service layer handling location-related operations
- Testing framework for validating location service behaviors

2. User Interactions
- No direct user interactions visible in the provided code
- Service layer component likely called by controllers/APIs

3. Data Handling
- Integrates with ClarifyInteractionAndWorkflowDao for data access
- Uses Collections utility, suggesting list/set operations
- Likely handles location data persistence and retrieval

4. Business Rules
- Cannot determine specific business rules from the limited code
- Service implementation suggests validation and processing of location data

5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Core dependency: ClarifyInteractionAndWorkflowDao
- Part of the 'cuco-core' module
- Located in test package, indicating test coverage requirements
- Integrated with 'bite.data.clarify' module

Additional Notes:
- Test class structure suggests unit testing requirements
- Service layer architecture pattern implementation
- Integration with a larger workflow system indicated by DAO naming

Note: Analysis is limited due to minimal code provided. Full implementation details would allow more comprehensive requirements documentation.
