# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/test/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/impl/LocationServiceImplTests.java

Based on the provided file content, here's the requirements analysis:

1. Purpose and Functionality
- This appears to be a test file for a Location Service implementation
- Primary purpose is to test location-related functionality
- Part of a core service layer in the 'cuco' system

2. User Interactions
- No direct user interactions visible as this is a test file
- Likely tests service methods that handle location operations

3. Data Handling
- Integrates with ClarifyInteractionAndWorkflowDao for data access
- Uses Collections utility, suggesting list/set operations
- Likely handles location data persistence and retrieval

4. Business Rules

- Test file suggests validation of location-related business logic

5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Depends on at.a1ta.bite.data.clarify.dao package
- Part of a larger core service architecture
- Requires integration with Clarify workflow system
- Uses Java Collections framework

Key Requirements:
1. Must implement location service functionality
2. Must integrate with Clarify interaction workflow
3. Must include proper test coverage
4. Must handle collection-based operations

Note: Limited code visibility makes detailed analysis challenging. Additional context would help provide more specific requirements.
