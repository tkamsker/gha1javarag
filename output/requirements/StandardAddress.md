# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/StandardAddress.java

StandardAddress.java

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents a standardized address entity
- Serves as a DTO for address information
- Implements Serializable for data transmission

2. Data handling:
- Implements custom hashCode() method for object comparison
- Manages address-related fields (indicated by 'additional' field in preview)
- Likely includes standard address components (street, city, etc.)

3. Business rules:
- Implements equality comparison through hashCode()
- Maintains standardized address format
- Associates with BiteUser entity

4. Dependencies:
- Java.io.Serializable
- Java.util.Date
- at.a1ta.bite.core.shared.dto.BiteUser

Common Patterns:
- All classes implement Serializable for data transfer
- Follow DTO pattern for data encapsulation
- Part of the at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.dto package
- Use standard Java date handling
- Maintain relationships with BiteUser entity where applicable
