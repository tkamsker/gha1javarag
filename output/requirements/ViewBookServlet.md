# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/ViewBookServlet.java

src/main/java/servlets/ViewBookServlet.java
### Purpose and Functionality:
The ViewBookServlet is designed to display detailed information about a specific book when requested by a user. It retrieves the book data from a database or another data source based on the book ID provided in the request.

### User Interactions:
- Users can click on a book link from a list view, which triggers this servlet.
- The servlet displays a page with comprehensive details of the selected book, including title, author, price, description, and availability.
- Users may have options to add the book to their cart or return to the previous page.

### Data Handling:
- The servlet fetches the book data from a database using a DAO (Data Access Object) or service layer.
- It retrieves all relevant fields of the Book object, such as title, author, ISBN, price, and description.
- The retrieved book data is stored in the request attribute for display on the JSP page.

### Business Rules:
- Ensure that the book exists in the database before attempting to retrieve it.
- Handle cases where the book may be out of stock by displaying appropriate messages or disabling purchase options.
- Validate user access to prevent unauthorized users from accessing restricted content.

### Dependencies and Relationships:
- Depends on the Book model class for data representation.
- Relies on a DAO or service layer for database interactions.
- Uses RequestDispatcher to forward requests to the corresponding JSP page for rendering.
