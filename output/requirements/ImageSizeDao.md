# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/ImageSizeDao.java

ImageSizeDao.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Data access interface for managing image size configurations
- Likely handles dimensions and size constraints for images in the system

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions as this is a data access layer

3. Data handling:
- Presumably manages image size metadata in the database
- Likely includes CRUD operations for image size configurations

4. Business rules:
- Must maintain valid image size parameters
- Enforces size constraints for the system

5. Dependencies:
- Part of the core DAO layer
- Likely depends on database connection infrastructure
- Used by higher-level services that handle image processing
