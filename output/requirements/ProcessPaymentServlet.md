# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/ProcessPaymentServlet.java

ProcessPaymentServlet.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `ProcessPaymentServlet` is responsible for handling payment processing during checkout. It receives payment details from the frontend, validates them, processes the transaction, updates the order status, and redirects the user to a success or failure page.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- Users submit their payment information through a checkout form.
- The servlet handles the POST request containing payment details.
- Upon successful processing, users are redirected to a confirmation page; otherwise, they see an error message.

### 3. Data Handling
- Retrieves cart items from the user's session.
- Calculates the total amount to be charged.
- Sends payment details (card information, amount) to a payment gateway for processing.
- Stores transaction details in the database if successful.

### 4. Business Rules
- Payment must be valid and sufficient to cover the order amount.
- If payment is successful, update the order status to "Completed."
- If payment fails, update the order status to "Failed" and notify the user.
- Send a confirmation email to the customer upon successful payment.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- `HttpSession` for accessing user session data.
- Payment gateway API for processing transactions.
- Database access for updating order status and storing transaction details.
- Constants from `BookStoreConstants` for configuration values.
