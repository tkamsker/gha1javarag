# Requirements Analysis: web/adminPatientList.jsp

Certainly! Here is a detailed requirements analysis for the file **web/adminPatientList.jsp**:

---

## 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Purpose:**  
This JSP file provides an administrative interface for viewing, searching, editing, and deleting patient records in a hospital management system.

**Functionality Implemented:**

- **Display Patient List:** Shows all patients in a tabular format, with key details (first name, last name, gender, etc.).
- **Search Patients:** Allows the admin to search for patients by first or last name.
- **Edit Patient:** Provides a link to edit patient details.
- **Delete Patient:** Provides a link to delete a patient record.
- **Navigation:** Includes a navigation bar for accessing other admin features (doctors, receptionists, workers, etc.).

---

## 2. User Interactions

**Who:**  
Admin users of the hospital management system.

**How:**

- **Navigation Bar:**  
  - Admin can navigate to Home, Patient, Doctor, Receptionist, and Worker management pages.
  - Dropdown menus allow quick access to "Add" and "View" pages for each entity.

- **Search Bar:**  
  - Admin can enter a search term (first or last name) and submit to filter the patient list.

- **Patient Table:**  
  - Admin can view a list of patients with their details.
  - For each patient, "Edit" and "Delete" actions are available:
    - **Edit:** Redirects to `updatePatient.jsp` with the patient's mobile number as a parameter.
    - **Delete:** Redirects to `deletePatient.jsp` with the patient's mobile number as a parameter.

## 3. Data Handling

**Data Sources:**

- **Database Table:**  
  - Table: `patient`
  - Fields displayed: fname, lname, gender, city, email, age, address, date, mobile

**Data Flow:**

- **Retrieval:**
  - On page load, the JSP establishes a database connection.
  - If a search term is provided, it executes a SQL query to filter patients by first or last name.
  - Otherwise, it retrieves all patients.

- **Display:**
  - Results are iterated and displayed in an HTML table.
  - Each row includes patient details and action links.

- **Actions:**
  - "Edit" and "Delete" links pass the patient's mobile number as a parameter to the respective JSPs for further processing.

**Security Note:**  
- The search query is constructed via string concatenation, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. (This is a design flaw, not a requirement, but should be noted.)

---

## 4. Business Rules

- **Patient Uniqueness:**  
  - Actions (edit/delete) are performed based on the patient's mobile number, implying it is a unique identifier.

- **Search Functionality:**  
  - Search is case-insensitive and matches any patient whose first or last name contains the search term.

- **Access Control:**  
  - Only admin users should have access to this page (though actual authentication/authorization is not shown in this file).

- **Data Integrity:**  
  - Editing or deleting a patient should only be possible if the patient exists in the database.

- **Navigation Consistency:**  
  - The navigation bar must be present on all admin pages for consistent user experience.

---

## 5. Dependencies and Relationships

**Dependencies:**

- **Database Connection:**
  - Uses `Database.DatabaseConnection.initializeDatabase()` to connect to the database.
  - Relies on the existence and correct configuration of the `patient` table.

- **Other JSP Pages:**
  - `updatePatient.jsp`: For editing patient details.
  - `deletePatient.jsp`: For deleting patient records.
  - `addpatient.jsp`: For adding new patients (linked in the navigation).
  - Other admin entity pages (doctors, receptionists, workers).

- **CSS and JS:**
  - Bootstrap and FontAwesome for styling.
  - Custom CSS files: `adddataform.css`, `adddatafrm1.css`, `table.css`.
  - jQuery and Popper.js for UI interactivity.

- **Images:**
  - Uses images for branding and background.

**Relationships:**

- **Entity Relationships:**
  - Patients are managed as part of the hospital's core data.
  - Admin users interact with patients, doctors, receptionists, and workers via similar interfaces.

- **Navigation Structure:**
  - The navigation bar links all admin management pages, ensuring easy access and workflow continuity.
