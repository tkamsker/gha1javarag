# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/impl/PartyDaoImpl.java

PartyDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose: Handles data access operations for party-related information
2. User Interactions: No direct user interactions; backend service
3. Data Handling:
   - Manages party-related data
   - Uses BigDecimal for precise numerical calculations
   - Implements collection handling (ArrayList, HashMap)
4. Business Rules:
   - Must maintain party relationship rules
   - Likely handles business party classifications
   - Integrates with settings service
5. Dependencies:
   - Extends AbstractDao
   - Uses Spring framework (@Autowired)
   - Depends on SettingService
   - Complex relationships indicated by multiple imports
   - Handles various collection types for data management

Common Patterns:
- All implementations extend AbstractDao
- Follow DAO pattern for data access
- Part of the at.a1ta.cuco.core system
- Implement specific interfaces for their domains
- Focus on backend data operations without direct UI interaction
