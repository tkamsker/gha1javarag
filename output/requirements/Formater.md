# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/export/Formater.java

Formater.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Defines interface for formatting objects to strings
- Provides contract for different formatter implementations
- Used in export framework

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Interface for implementing formatters

3. Data handling:
- Defines method to convert Object to String
- No direct data handling (interface only)

4. Business rules:
- Requires implementation of format(Object) method
- Used as contract for various formatters

5. Dependencies:
- Core interface with no external dependencies
- Other classes implement this interface (e.g., DateFormater)
- Part of export framework architecture

These files form part of a data export framework, with Formater providing the interface contract, DateFormater implementing date formatting capabilities, and TableContent managing tabular data structure for export operations.
