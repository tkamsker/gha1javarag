# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/impl/SettingsEditorDAOImpl.java

SettingsEditorDAOImpl.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Data access implementation for system settings management
- Handles retrieval and possibly modification of application settings
- Provides access to configuration parameters

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions (DAO layer)

3. Data handling:
- Retrieves Setting objects
- Uses "cucoSettings" namespace for queries
- Returns lists of settings

4. Business rules:
- Must provide access to system configuration settings
- Settings should be retrievable as a complete list
- Likely supports read-only or read-write operations for settings

5. Dependencies:
- Extends AbstractDao
- Implements SettingsEditorDAO interface
- Uses Setting DTO
- Relies on SQL mapping for settings queries

All three implementations follow similar patterns as they:
- Are part of the core DAO layer
- Extend AbstractDao for common functionality
- Implement specific DAO interfaces
- Handle specific types of data objects
- Use SQL mapping for database operations
