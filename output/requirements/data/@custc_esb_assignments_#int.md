cuco.dbmaintain/sql/repeat/esb/@custc_esb_assignments_#int.sql and #dev.sql

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Configures Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) connection parameters
- Sets up access assignments for ESB integration
- Manages environment-specific connection details

2. Data handling:
- Manages two tables:
  * BITE_ESB_ACCESS_ASSIGNMENTS
  * BITE_ESB_ACCESS_PARAMETERS
- Stores connection parameters including:
  * JMS server addresses
  * Credentials
  * Timeout settings
  * Instance information
  * Service URLs

3. Business rules:
- Environment-specific configurations (DEV environment)
- Requires specific server addresses and ports
- Includes security credentials
- Defines timeout constraints

4. Dependencies and relationships:
- Integrated with A1 Telekom infrastructure
- Depends on ESB availability
- Requires JMS server access
- Connected to specific environment instances (dev/int)

Note: Both files (#int and #dev) appear to contain similar structures but target different environments, suggesting environment-specific configuration management.
