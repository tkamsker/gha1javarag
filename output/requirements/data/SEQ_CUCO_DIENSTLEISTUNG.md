SEQ_CUCO_DIENSTLEISTUNG.sql
1. Purpose: Creates a sequence generator for service (Dienstleistung) IDs
2. Functionality:
- Generates unique numeric identifiers for services
- Starts at 10582
- Increments by 1
- Uses cache size of 20 for performance
3. Data handling:
- Maintains sequence values between 1 and 999999999999999999999999999
- Non-cycling sequence
- No guaranteed ordering
4. Business rules:
- Sequential unique IDs required for service entities
- Cache size suggests moderate insertion rate expected
5. Dependencies:
- Used by tables/entities that reference service IDs
- Must be created before dependent objects

Common patterns across all sequences:
- All use cache size of 20
- All are non-cycling
- All use increment of 1
- All have different starting points
- All are used for ID generation in their respective domains
- All follow similar naming convention (seq_[domain]_[entity])
