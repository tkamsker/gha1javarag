**File Type:** SQL script

SEQ_CUCO_SEGIMPORT.sql
1. Purpose: Creates a sequence for generating unique segment import IDs
2. User interactions: No direct user interaction - used internally
3. Data handling:
   - Generates sequential numbers starting at 42
   - Increments by 1
   - No caching (NOCACHE) - suggests high consistency requirements
   - No cycling
4. Business rules:
   - Must be positive numbers (minimum 1)
   - Very large maximum value
   - Numbers must be unique
   - Stricter consistency requirements (no caching)
5. Dependencies:
   - Likely used by CUCO_SEGIMPORT table for primary key generation
   - Part of the CUSTC schema
   - May be critical for data import processes

Common characteristics across all sequences:
- Part of CUCO V3.0.0.0 schema creation
- Used for generating unique identifiers
- Follow similar pattern but with different starting values
- Implemented in Oracle database
- Support very large number ranges
