Types.sql
Note: Content preview is empty, but based on filename:

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Likely defines custom data types for the CUSTC schema
- Creates user-defined types for specialized data handling

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Supports data type definitions for application use

3. Data handling:
- Would define custom data structures
- Supports complex data types beyond standard SQL types

4. Business rules:
- Would enforce data structure consistency
- Supports business-specific data requirements

5. Dependencies:
- Must be created before tables using custom types
- Part of schema creation process
- May depend on built-in database types

Note: Without actual content, the Types.sql analysis is based on typical usage patterns and naming convention.
