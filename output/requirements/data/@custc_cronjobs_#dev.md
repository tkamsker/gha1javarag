@custc_cronjobs_#dev.sql
1. Purpose: Configures development environment scheduled tasks
2. User interactions: None - system automation only
3. Data handling:
   - Identical structure to production but with different activation states
   - Uses same bite_cronjob table
4. Business rules:
   - Development-specific job activation states
   - Same jobs as production but some disabled for development:
     - Clarify interaction cache updates (enabled)
     - Coupon series import (disabled)
     - Customer interaction processing (disabled)
5. Dependencies:
   - bite_cronjob table
   - Development environment specific
   - Testing/development infrastructure

Common Patterns:
- Environment-specific configurations (#prod vs #dev)
- Consistent table structures across environments
- Clear separation of settings and scheduled tasks
- Use of standard cron patterns for job scheduling
