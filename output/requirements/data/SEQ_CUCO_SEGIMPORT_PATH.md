SEQ_CUCO_SEGIMPORT_PATH.sql
1. Purpose: Creates a sequence generator for segment import path IDs in the CUCO system
2. User interactions: No direct user interaction; used internally by the database
3. Data handling:
   - Generates sequential numbers starting at 412
   - No caching (NOCACHE) for immediate consistency
   - Increments by 1
   - No cycling
4. Business rules:
   - Minimum value: 1
   - Maximum value: 999999999999999999999999999
   - Non-ordered sequence
5. Dependencies:
   - Used by tables tracking segment import paths
   - Must be created before any tables referencing this sequence
   - Likely part of a larger import/segmentation system

Common Characteristics:
- All sequences are part of the CUSTC schema
- All follow similar pattern of unlimited maximum values
- All use increment by 1
- All are non-cycling
- All are part of the CUCO V3.0.0.0 schema creation
