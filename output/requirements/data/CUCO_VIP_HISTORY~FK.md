2. User interactions: No direct user interactions; ensures referential integrity
3. Data handling:
   - Links VIP history records to user records
   - Prevents orphaned VIP history records
4. Business rules: Every VIP history record must reference a valid user in app_benutzer
5. Dependencies:
   - Requires existing cuco_vip_history table
   - Requires existing app_benutzer table
   - Requires benutzer_id columns in both tables
   - Requires primary key on app_benutzer.benutzer_id

These files are part of a database schema creation/maintenance system, focusing on establishing proper relationships, constraints, and performance optimizations for what appears to be a customer management system with VIP tracking capabilities.
