# Requirements Analysis: administration.ui/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/admin/ui/common/client/service/VIPHistoryServletAsync.java

VIPHistoryServletAsync.java
1. Purpose: Asynchronous interface for VIP history operations
2. User interactions: None directly - defines async service contract
3. Data handling:
   - Async retrieval of VIP history entries
   - Parameters: date range, search term, VIP status
   - Returns List<VIPHistoryEntry> through callback
4. Business rules:
   - Asynchronous operation pattern
   - Callback-based response handling
5. Dependencies:
   - GWT AsyncCallback framework
   - VIPHistoryEntry DTO
   - Java Date utilities
   - VIPHistoryServlet (synchronous counterpart)

Common Requirements Across Files:
1. System must provide centralized access to administrative services
2. VIP history tracking must support:
   - Date range filtering
   - Search term filtering
   - VIP status filtering
3. All remote operations must be asynchronous
4. Service endpoints must follow GWT RPC patterns
5. System must maintain type safety through DTOs
