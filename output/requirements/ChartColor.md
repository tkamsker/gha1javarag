# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/chart/ChartColor.java

ChartColor.java

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Defines an enumeration of standard colors for chart visualization
- Provides RGB color values for basic chart colors (red, green, blue, black)
- Encapsulates color definition in a type-safe manner

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Used by chart rendering components to apply consistent colors

3. Data handling:
- Stores RGB values as public final integers
- Each color constant has fixed RGB values
- Values are immutable once defined

4. Business rules:
- RGB values must be between 0-255
- Pre-defined set of colors only
- Cannot be modified at runtime

5. Dependencies:
- Used by chart visualization components
- Part of the chart DTO package
