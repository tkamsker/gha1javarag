2. User interactions:
- Associates files with users (BiteUser)
- Tracks file creation/modification dates

3. Data handling:
- Implements Serializable for data persistence
- Includes copy constructor for object duplication
- Manages file metadata

4. Business rules:
- Must maintain file ownership information
- Requires date tracking for files
- Must be serializable for system operations

5. Dependencies and relationships:
- Depends on BiteUser class
