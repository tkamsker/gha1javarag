# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/CheckoutServlet.java

src/main/java/servlets/CheckoutServlet.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The CheckoutServlet handles the final step of the purchasing process where users review their cart, confirm their order details, and proceed with payment. It processes the user's cart data, validates it, calculates the total price, and initiates the payment process.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- **Registered Users**: This servlet is accessed by registered users who have items in their shopping cart and are ready to complete their purchase.
- **Order Review**: The user reviews their order details, checks the quantities, and confirms the shipping address before proceeding to payment.
- **Payment Processing**: The user enters payment information (e.g., credit card details) and submits the order for processing.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Cart Retrieval**: The servlet retrieves the user's cart data from the session or database.
- **Order Validation**: It validates the cart items, ensuring that all selected books are still available in sufficient quantity.
- **Payment Processing**: The total amount is calculated, and payment processing is initiated (integration with a payment gateway may be required).
- **Order Confirmation**: Upon successful payment, the order is confirmed, and the user is redirected to a confirmation page.

### 4. Business Rules
- Users must be logged in to access this servlet.
- All items in the cart must be available in sufficient quantity at the time of checkout.
- The total price must include any applicable taxes and shipping costs.
- If payment processing fails, the user should be notified, and their cart data should remain intact for re-attempting the purchase.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- **Imports**: Utilizes classes from `com.bittercode.constant.BookStoreConstants` and `com.bittercode.model.UserRole`.
- **DAO Layer**: Relies on DAO classes (e.g., BookDAO, OrderDAO) for interacting with the database.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: May depend on external libraries or services for processing payments.
- **RequestDispatcher**: Used to forward the request to the appropriate JSP page based on the outcome of the checkout process.
