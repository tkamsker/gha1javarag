# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/impl/ImageSizeServiceImpl.java

ImageSizeServiceImpl.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Implements service for managing image size configurations
- Handles image dimension related operations
- Provides interface for image size management

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions, backend service component

3. Data handling:
- Manages image size configurations
- Uses ImageSizeDao for persistence
- Handles lists of ImageSize objects

4. Business rules:
- Implements image size management logic
- Likely enforces valid dimension constraints
- Manages image size configuration rules

5. Dependencies:
- ImageSizeDao for data access
- ImageSizeService interface implementation
- ImageSize DTO objects
- No Spring annotations visible, likely manually configured

Each implementation follows a service layer pattern within what appears to be a larger customer management system, with clear separation of concerns and dependency injection patterns.
