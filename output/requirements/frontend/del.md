del.js
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Manages deleted text element dialog in TinyMCE editor
- Handles insertion and updating of HTML <del> tags
- Supports datetime attributes for deletion tracking
- Part of XHTML extras plugin suite

2. User interactions:
- Opens dialog for creating/editing deleted text
- Provides update functionality for existing deleted text
- Manages datetime attribute input
- Shows remove button when editing existing elements

3. Data handling:
- Manages DOM element creation and modification
- Handles deletion attributes including datetime
- Processes form values for datetime attribute

4. Business rules:
- Must maintain datetime information for deletions
- Must initialize dialog differently for new vs existing deletions
- Follows XHTML standards for deletion markup

5. Dependencies:
- Requires TinyMCE editor framework
- Depends on SXE (Shared XHTML Extras) utility
- Uses tinyMCEPopup for dialog management
- Requires datetime handling functionality

All three files are part of TinyMCE's XHTML extras plugin suite and share similar architectural patterns while handling different HTML elements. They all rely on the SXE utility for common functionality and follow consistent interaction patterns.
