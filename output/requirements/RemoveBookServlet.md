RemoveBookServlet.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `RemoveBookServlet` allows users to remove books, likely from a cart or inventory, based on their role. It checks user permissions before processing the removal request.

### 2. User Interactions
- Users with appropriate roles can initiate book removal.
- The servlet validates the user's role before proceeding.

### 3. Data Handling
- Receives book details and user information from the request.
- Validates the user's role using `UserRole`.
- Processes the removal if permissions are granted.

### 4. Business Rules
- Only users with specific roles (e.g., admin) can remove books.
- Removal actions must be authorized based on user privileges.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Imports `UserRole` to check user permissions.
- May depend on services or DAOs for book removal operations.
