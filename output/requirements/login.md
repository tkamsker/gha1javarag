# Requirements Analysis: WebContent/login.html

WebContent/login.html
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The login.html file serves as the entry point for users to access their accounts on the Book Store platform. It provides a form where users can input their credentials (email and password) to authenticate themselves.

### 2. User Interactions
- Users enter their email address and password into the respective fields.
- They click the "Login" button to submit the form.
- Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the home page or dashboard.
- If login fails due to incorrect credentials, an error message is displayed.

### 3. Data Handling
- The form collects user input (email and password) and sends it to a server-side script for validation.
- The server verifies the credentials against the database of registered users.
- Upon successful validation, session data may be created to maintain the user's logged-in state.

### 4. Business Rules
- Users must provide valid email and password combinations to log in.
- If login attempts fail, users are notified with an appropriate message.
- The system enforces security measures such as rate-limiting or account lockouts after multiple failed attempts (if applicable).

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Relies on server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Node.js) to process the login request.
- Depends on a database to store and retrieve user credentials.
- Integrates with other pages such as the home page or dashboard for post-login navigation.
