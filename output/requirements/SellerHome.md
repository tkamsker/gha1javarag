# Requirements Analysis: WebContent/SellerHome.html

WebContent/SellerHome.html
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
- **Purpose**: This HTML file serves as the home page for sellers within an online bookstore application. It provides a user interface for sellers to interact with their account, manage products, view orders, and access other seller-specific features.
- **Functionality**:
  - Displays seller-specific information such as current orders, inventory status, and earnings.
  - Provides navigation links or buttons to access different sections of the seller's dashboard (e.g., product management, order history, profile settings).
  - Includes a logout option for security.

### 2. User Interactions
- **Login/Logout**: Sellers can log in to their accounts and securely log out when done.
- **Navigation**: Sellers can navigate through different sections of the seller's dashboard (e.g., product management, order history, profile settings).
- **Product Management**: Sellers can add, edit, or delete products from their inventory.
- **Order Management**: Sellers can view and manage orders, including tracking order status and fulfilling orders.
- **Profile Management**: Sellers can update their personal and business information.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Displaying Seller Information**: The page retrieves and displays seller-specific data such as current orders, inventory levels, and earnings from a backend database or service.
- **Storing Seller Preferences**: The page may store seller preferences (e.g., language settings, notification preferences) in cookies or a backend database.
- **Processing Actions**: The page processes user actions (e.g., adding a product, updating profile information) by sending requests to the server via servlets or APIs.

### 4. Business Rules
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Sellers must be authenticated before accessing the seller's dashboard. Only authorized sellers can view and manage their products and orders.
- **Data Validation**: Input data (e.g., product details, order updates) must be validated to ensure correctness and prevent errors.
- **Session Management**: The application must maintain user sessions securely to protect sensitive information.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- **Server-Side Components**: Relies on servlets (e.g., SellerLoginServlet) and backend services to handle user requests and retrieve/store data.
- **Database**: Interacts with a database to store and retrieve seller information, product details, and order data.
- **External Libraries/Frameworks**: May depend on external libraries or frameworks for styling (e.g., CSS), form validation, or other functionalities.
