# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/esb/BusinessHardwareReplacementDaoImpl.java

BusinessHardwareReplacementDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose: Implements business hardware replacement operations through ESB
2. User interactions: None (DAO layer)
3. Data handling:
   - Processes hardware replacement requests
   - Handles decimal and integer calculations
   - Manages remote ESB communications
4. Business rules:
   - Hardware replacement business logic
   - Error handling for remote operations
5. Dependencies:
   - Spring framework (@Repository, @Scope)
   - BaseEsbClient
   - ESB exception handling
   - Mobile points DTOs
   - BigDecimal/BigInteger for calculations

Common Patterns:
- All files are part of the ESB DAO layer
- Use Spring framework for dependency injection
- Implement ESB client communication
- Focus on specific business domains
- Follow DAO pattern for data access abstraction
