## POM.xml Analysis

040_test_deletes_rufnummer.sql

1. **Purpose and Overview**
   - Manages deletion of test phone number records
   - Part of test data cleanup framework
   - Coordinates with account deletion process

2. **Key Components**
   - DELETE operations on RUFNUMMER1 and RUFNUMMER2 tables
   - Structured for multiple test customer records
   - Parallel structure to account deletion script

3. **Data Structures**
   - Two phone number tables: RUFNUMMER1 and RUFNUMMER2
   - Referenced by kunde_id (customer ID)
   - Maintains consistent test ID pattern

4. **Business Rules**
   - Phone numbers must be deleted for specific test customer IDs
   - Deletion sequence must maintain data integrity
   - Both RUFNUMMER1 and RUFNUMMER2 records must be removed

5. **Integration Points**
   - Must be executed after or with account deletions
   - Part of larger test data management framework
   - May have dependencies on other cleanup operations

6. **Security Considerations**
   - Restricted to test environment execution
   - Requires appropriate database access rights
   - Must prevent production environment execution

7. **Performance Notes**
   - Consider combining DELETE statements
   - Evaluate batch deletion approach
   - Ensure proper indexing on kunde_id

8. **Debug Insights**
   - Add transaction control
   - Implement error handling
   - Consider adding execution logging
   - Validate deletion success

General Recommendations:
- Implement script execution order control
- Add verification steps for successful deletion
- Consider combining related cleanup scripts
- Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Add documentation for test data management process
- Consider using stored procedures for better maintainability
- Implement logging and monitoring capabilities
