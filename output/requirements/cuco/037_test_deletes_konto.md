## POM.xml Analysis

037_test_deletes_konto.sql

1. **Purpose and Overview**
   - Primary purpose is to clean up test account data from the KONTO tables
   - Part of test data management framework for database cleanup operations
   - Specifically targets test accounts with predefined customer IDs

2. **Key Components**
   - DELETE operations on KONTO1 and KONTO2 tables
   - Structured to handle multiple test customer accounts
   - Sequential deletion pattern for related account records

3. **Data Structures**
   - Two account tables: KONTO1 and KONTO2 (likely representing different account types or versions)
   - Primary key relationship with kunde_id (customer ID)
   - Test data uses specific ID range (999999991-999999994)

4. **Business Rules**
   - Test accounts must be identified by specific kunde_id pattern (9999999xx)
   - Deletions must maintain referential integrity
   - Both KONTO1 and KONTO2 records must be deleted for each customer

5. **Integration Points**
   - Must be executed as part of test data cleanup process
   - Dependencies on customer ID references
   - May need to be coordinated with other cleanup scripts

6. **Security Considerations**
   - Script should only run in test environment
   - Requires appropriate database permissions
   - Must prevent accidental execution in production

7. **Performance Notes**
   - Multiple individual DELETE statements may be consolidated
   - Consider batch deletion for better performance
   - Index on kunde_id recommended

8. **Debug Insights**
   - Consider adding transaction boundaries
   - Add error handling and logging
   - Consider using truncate for full test data cleanup
