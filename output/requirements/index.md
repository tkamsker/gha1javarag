# Requirements Analysis: web/index.jsp

Certainly! Here is a detailed requirements analysis for the provided `web/index.jsp` file of a Hospital Management System:

---

## 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Purpose:**  
The `index.jsp` file serves as the landing (home) page for the Hospital Management System web application. Its primary function is to present a user interface for users to log in, and to provide navigation to the admin login and user registration pages.

**Functionality Implemented:**
- Displays a branded home page with a hospital-themed background and logo.
- Provides a navigation bar with links to Home and Admin login.
- Presents a user login form for authentication.
- Offers a link for new users to register (create an account).

---

## 2. User Interactions

**User Actions Supported:**
- **Navigation:**  
  - Users can click on "Home" to reload the home page.
  - Users can click on "Admin" to navigate to the admin login page (`adminLogin.jsp`).

- **Login:**  
  - Users can enter their username and password in the login form.
  - Users can submit the form to log in as a regular user.

- **Registration:**  
  - Users who do not have an account can click "Create Account" to go to the registration page (`userRegister.jsp`).

**UI Elements:**
- Navigation bar (with logo and links)
- Main heading ("Hospital Management System")
- Login form (username, password, submit button)
- Registration link

---

## 3. Data Handling

**Data Collected:**
- **Username:**  
  - Collected via a text input field (`name="username"`).
- **Password:**  
  - Collected via a password input field (`name="password"`).

**Data Submission:**
- The login form submits data via HTTP POST to the endpoint `/UserLogin` (relative to the application context path).
- No client-side validation is shown in this file; validation is likely handled server-side.

**Data Flow:**
- User enters credentials → submits form → data sent to server for authentication.

---

## 4. Business Rules

**Implicit Business Rules:**
- **Authentication Required:**  
  - Users must log in with valid credentials to access user-specific features.
- **Account Creation:**  
  - Only registered users can log in; new users must create an account via the registration page.
- **Role Separation:**  
  - There is a distinction between regular users and admins, as indicated by separate login paths (user login on this page, admin login via `adminLogin.jsp`).
- **Security:**  
  - Passwords are not visible as they are entered (input type is "password").
- **Navigation Consistency:**  
  - Navigation bar is present on the home page for easy access to main sections.

---

## 5. Dependencies and Relationships

**Front-End Dependencies:**
- **Bootstrap:**  
  - Multiple versions of Bootstrap CSS and JS are included for responsive design and UI components.
- **jQuery:**  
  - Included for DOM manipulation and possibly for future dynamic behaviors.
- **Font Awesome:**  
  - Included for icon support, though not directly used in this snippet.
- **Custom CSS:**  
  - `css/style.css` for additional styling.
- **Images:**  
  - Uses `img/Medical.jpg` for background and `img/2855.jpeg` for the logo.

**Back-End Relationships:**
- **User Authentication Endpoint:**  
  - The form submits to `/UserLogin`, which must be implemented as a servlet or controller to handle authentication.
- **Admin Login:**  
  - Link to `adminLogin.jsp` for admin authentication.
- **User Registration:**  
  - Link to `userRegister.jsp` for new user account creation.

**Other Relationships:**
- **Session Management:**  
  - Not shown here, but implied: successful login would establish a user session.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Not present in this file; likely handled in the login servlet or controller.
