# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/AddBookServlet.java

src/main/java/servlets/AddBookServlet.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The AddBookServlet is designed to handle the addition of new books to the bookstore's database. It processes HTTP POST requests containing book details, validates the input data, generates a unique identifier for the book using UUID, and stores the book information in the database.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- **Admin Users**: This servlet is intended for administrative users who have the necessary permissions to add new books to the store. The admin would typically interact with this servlet through a form submission on an admin dashboard or interface.
- **Form Submission**: The user provides book details such as title, author, ISBN, price, and description via a web form. Upon submission, the servlet processes the data.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Input Data**: The servlet receives book details from the request parameters including title, author, ISBN, price, and description.
- **UUID Generation**: A unique identifier for each book is generated using UUID.randomUUID().
- **Database Interaction**: The book data is stored in the database using a DAO (Data Access Object) class. If the operation is successful, the user is redirected to a success page; otherwise, an error message is displayed.

### 4. Business Rules
- Only users with administrative privileges (UserRole.ADMIN) can access this functionality.
- All required fields must be provided and validated before storing the book in the database.
- The ISBN field must be unique across all books in the database to avoid duplicates.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- **Imports**: Utilizes classes from `com.bittercode.constant.BookStoreConstants`, `com.bittercode.constant.db.Book`, and `java.util.UUID`.
- **DAO Layer**: Relies on a DAO class (e.g., BookDAO) for database operations.
- **RequestDispatcher**: Used to forward the request to the appropriate JSP page based on the outcome of the operation.
