# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/StoreBookServlet.java

src/main/java/servlets/StoreBookServlet.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The StoreBookServlet is responsible for displaying a list of books available in the bookstore. It retrieves book data from the database, organizes it into a suitable format, and forwards the information to a JSP page for rendering.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- **General Users**: This servlet serves all users who visit the bookstore's homepage or browse section. Users can view available books, read descriptions, check prices, and add items to their cart.
- **Search/Filter Options**: The servlet may support basic search functionality or filtering options based on categories, price ranges, or popularity.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Database Retrieval**: The servlet fetches a list of all books (or filtered results) from the database using a DAO class.
- **Data Preparation**: The retrieved book data is prepared for display, potentially including pagination or sorting.
- **Forwarding to JSP**: The list of books and any additional context (e.g., user role, cart information) are passed to the JSP page for rendering.

### 4. Business Rules
- Books must be displayed in a user-friendly manner with all relevant details such as title, author, price, and availability.
- Users must be logged in to add items to their cart or proceed to checkout.
- The servlet may implement caching mechanisms to improve performance if frequently accessed data is involved.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- **Imports**: Utilizes classes from `com.bittercode.model.Book` and `com.bittercode.model.UserRole`.
- **DAO Layer**: Relies on a DAO class (e.g., BookDAO) for retrieving book data.
- **RequestDispatcher**: Used to forward the request to the appropriate JSP page.
