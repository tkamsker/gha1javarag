# Requirements Analysis: web/deletePatient.jsp

Certainly! Here is a detailed requirements analysis for the provided `deletePatient.jsp` file:

---

## 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Purpose:**  
The primary purpose of `deletePatient.jsp` is to delete a patient record from the database based on a mobile number provided as a request parameter. This page is likely part of an administrative interface for managing patient records.

**Functionality:**  
- Receives a mobile number (`mob`) as a request parameter.
- Connects to the database.
- Executes a SQL `DELETE` statement to remove the patient whose `mobile` field matches the provided number.
- Closes the database connection.
- Forwards the user to `AdminHome.jsp` after the operation.

---

## 2. User Interactions

**Direct User Interaction:**  
- There is no direct user interface on this page (no forms, buttons, or links visible to the user).
- The user (likely an admin) interacts with this functionality indirectly, probably by clicking a "Delete" button or link elsewhere in the application, which sends a request to this JSP with the appropriate `mob` parameter.

**Flow:**  
1. Admin selects a patient to delete (possibly from a list).
2. The system sends a request to `deletePatient.jsp?mob=<mobile_number>`.
3. The JSP processes the deletion and redirects the admin to the home page.

## 3. Data Handling

**Input Data:**
- **Request Parameter:**  
  - `mob` (String): The mobile number of the patient to be deleted. This is expected to be unique or at least uniquely identify a patient in the database.

**Database Interaction:**
- **Connection:**  
  - Uses a helper class `DatabaseConnection` to initialize a database connection.
- **SQL Operation:**  
  - Executes: `DELETE FROM patient WHERE mobile = '<mob>'`
  - This removes all records from the `patient` table where the `mobile` column matches the provided value.

**Output Data:**
- No data is rendered to the user on this page.
- After deletion, the user is forwarded to `AdminHome.jsp`.

**Security Note:**  
- The code directly concatenates the `mob` parameter into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This is a significant security risk.

---

## 4. Business Rules

**Explicit Business Rules:**
- Only patients whose mobile number matches the provided parameter will be deleted.
- The operation is performed without confirmation or validation within this JSP.

**Implicit Business Rules:**
- The mobile number is assumed to be a unique identifier for patients.
- Only authorized users (admins) should be able to access this functionality (though no authentication or authorization checks are present in this code).
- After deletion, the admin is returned to the home page, suggesting that the operation is considered complete and successful.

**Missing/Unimplemented Rules:**
- No confirmation dialog or undo functionality.
- No error handling (e.g., what if the mobile number does not exist, or the database operation fails?).
- No logging or audit trail for deletions.
- No validation of the `mob` parameter (e.g., format, existence).

---

## 5. Dependencies and Relationships

**Dependencies:**
- **DatabaseConnection class:**  
  - Used to initialize the database connection.
- **Database:**  
  - The `patient` table must exist with a `mobile` column.
- **Java EE/JSP Environment:**  
  - Uses JSP scripting, request/response objects, and `RequestDispatcher`.
- **AdminHome.jsp:**  
  - The user is forwarded to this page after deletion.

**Relationships:**
- **Upstream:**  
  - Likely called from an admin interface where patient records are listed.
- **Downstream:**  
  - Forwards to `AdminHome.jsp` after completion.

**Other Considerations:**
- The file is tightly coupled to the database schema (specifically the `patient` table and `mobile` column).
- No abstraction or reuse; all logic is embedded in the JSP.

## Summary Table

| Aspect                | Details                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Delete a patient record by mobile number                                |
| **User Interaction**  | Indirect (via request parameter, likely from admin UI)                  |
| **Input**             | `mob` parameter (mobile number)                                         |
| **Output**            | None (forwards to AdminHome.jsp)                                        |
| **Business Rules**    | Delete patient where mobile matches; no confirmation or error handling   |
| **Dependencies**      | DatabaseConnection, patient table, AdminHome.jsp                        |
| **Security**          | Vulnerable to SQL injection; no authentication/authorization checks     |

## Recommendations

- **Security:** Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
- **Error Handling:** Add error handling and user feedback.
- **Validation:** Validate the `mob` parameter.
- **Authorization:** Ensure only authorized users can perform deletions.
- **User Experience:** Consider adding confirmation dialogs and success/error messages.
