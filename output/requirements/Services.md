# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/salesinfo/visitreport/digitalselling/Services.java

Services.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Data transfer object (DTO) for services information in digital selling visit reports
- Implements Serializable for object serialization/deserialization
- Uses XML binding annotations for XML data mapping

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions as this is a data model class

3. Data handling:
- Serializable for data persistence and transfer
- XML annotations suggest this class is used for XML data exchange
- Field-level XML access type indicates direct field mapping

4. Business rules:
- Must maintain serialization compatibility (serialVersionUID)
- Fields must conform to XML binding requirements

5. Dependencies:
- Part of digital selling visit report data structure
- Depends on Java XML binding (javax.xml.bind) framework
- Integrated into larger sales information system
