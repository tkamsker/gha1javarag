# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/CustomerLoginServlet.java

CustomerLoginServlet.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `CustomerLoginServlet` is designed to handle customer login functionality. It processes user authentication by verifying credentials against a database. Upon successful login, it redirects the user to a dashboard or home page; on failure, it displays an error message.

### 2. User Interactions
- Users input their username and password.
- The servlet validates these inputs against stored data.
- Success: Redirects to the dashboard.
- Failure: Shows an error message prompting re-entry.

### 3. Data Handling
- Receives username and password from the request.
- Queries the database using `UsersDBConstants` for user validation.
- Stores session information upon successful login.

### 4. Business Rules
- Only registered users with valid credentials can log in.
- Session management is enforced to maintain user state across requests.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Imports constants from `BookStoreConstants` and `UsersDBConstants`.
- Relies on a database for user authentication.
- May depend on services or DAOs for data retrieval.
