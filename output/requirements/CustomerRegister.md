# Requirements Analysis: WebContent/CustomerRegister.html

WebContent/CustomerRegister.html
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The CustomerRegister.html file allows new customers to create an account on the Book Store platform. It provides a registration form where users can input their personal details, including name, email, password, and other relevant information.

### 2. User Interactions
- Users fill out the registration form with their personal details.
- They click the "Register" button to submit the form.
- Upon successful registration, users are typically redirected to a confirmation page or logged in automatically.
- If registration fails (e.g., due to invalid input or duplicate email), an error message is displayed.

### 3. Data Handling
- The form collects user input (name, email, password, etc.) and sends it to a server-side script for processing.
- The server validates the input data according to predefined rules (e.g., email format, password complexity).
- Upon successful validation, the user's information is stored in the database.

### 4. Business Rules
- Users must provide valid and complete registration details.
- Email addresses must be unique to prevent duplicate accounts.
- Passwords must meet specific criteria (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of special characters).

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Relies on server-side scripts to handle form submission and data validation.
- Depends on a database to store user information securely.
- Integrates with other pages such as the login page or dashboard for post-registration navigation.
