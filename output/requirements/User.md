# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/com/bittercode/model/User.java

src/main/java/com/bittercode/model/User.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
- Represents a user entity in the application.
- Contains fields for user details such as email, password, name, phone, address, and roles.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- Users interact with this class indirectly through registration, login, or profile updates.
- Developers use this class to manage user data across different layers of the application.

### 3. Data Handling
- Fields:
  - `emailId`: String representing the user's email address.
  - `password`: String representing the user's password (hashed in production).
  - `firstName`, `lastName`: Strings for the user's name.
  - `phone`: Long representing the user's phone number.
  - `address`: String representing the user's address.
  - `roles`: List of `UserRole` objects representing the user's roles.
- Methods:
  - Getters and setters for all fields.

### 4. Business Rules
- Email addresses must be unique across users.
- Passwords must meet complexity requirements (e.g., length, special characters).
- Roles determine user permissions within the application.
- Address validation may be required based on business needs.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Implements `Serializable` for object persistence or network transmission.
- Depends on `UserRole` class for role management.
