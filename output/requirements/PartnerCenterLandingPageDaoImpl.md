# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/esb/PartnerCenterLandingPageDaoImpl.java

PartnerCenterLandingPageDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose: Implementation class for partner center landing page data access
2. User interactions: None directly - backend service implementation
3. Data handling:
   - Likely handles partner center related data operations
   - Includes PWUTokenResponse processing
4. Business rules:
   - Implements error handling for RemoteException
   - Uses assertion checks for validation
5. Dependencies:
   - Spring Framework (@Repository)
   - BaseEsbClient
   - SLF4J logging
   - BITE core server ESB components
   - PWUTokenResponse bean

Common Patterns:
- All files are part of the ESB DAO layer
- Follow data access object pattern
- Part of the cuco-core module
- Focus on backend integration and data retrieval
- No direct user interface components

Requirements:
1. System must provide data access interfaces for ESB integration
2. Must handle business hardware replacement queries
3. Must support partner center operations
4. Must implement proper error handling and logging
5. Must maintain separation of concerns between interface and implementation
6. Must follow Spring Framework patterns and conventions
