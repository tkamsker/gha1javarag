# Requirements Analysis: web/listPatient.jsp

Certainly! Here is a detailed requirements analysis for the file **web/listPatient.jsp** based on the provided code.

---

## 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Purpose:**  
The primary purpose of `listPatient.jsp` is to display a list of patients in a hospital management system. It provides a user interface for viewing patient details and searching for patients by their first or last name.

**Functionality:**
- Presents a table of all patients stored in the database.
- Allows users to search for patients by first or last name.
- Displays patient details such as First Name, Last Name, Gender, City, Email, Age, Address, Date, and Mobile.
- Integrates with the rest of the hospital management system via navigation links.

## 2. User Interactions

**Navigation:**
- Users access this page via the navigation bar, specifically under the "PATIENT" dropdown as "Patient List".
- The navigation bar also allows users to go to "Home", "Add Patient", and billing-related pages.

**Search:**
- Users can enter a search term in the search bar at the top of the patient list.
- The search is performed on both the first name (`fname`) and last name (`lname`) fields.
- Upon submitting the search form, the page reloads and displays only the patients matching the search criteria.

**Viewing Data:**
- Users see a table with all patient records (or filtered records if a search is performed).
- Each row in the table represents a patient, with columns for their details.

## 3. Data Handling

**Data Source:**
- Patient data is retrieved from a database table named `patient`.

**Database Connection:**
- Uses a helper class `DatabaseConnection` to initialize the database connection.
- Executes SQL queries to fetch patient records.

**Query Logic:**
- If a search term is provided (`request.getParameter("search")`), the SQL query filters patients whose first or last name contains the search term.
- If no search term is provided, all patients are fetched.

**Data Display:**
- The result set from the SQL query is iterated, and each patient's details are displayed in the table.

**Data Fields Displayed:**
1. First Name
2. Last Name
3. Gender
4. City
5. Email
6. Age
7. Address
8. Date
9. Mobile

**Security Note:**  
- The search query is constructed via string concatenation, which is vulnerable to SQL injection. This is a technical risk, not a requirement, but should be noted for future improvement.

---

## 4. Business Rules

**Explicit Rules:**
- All patients in the database are displayed unless a search term is provided.
- Search is case-insensitive and matches any substring in the first or last name.

**Implicit Rules:**
- The table must always show the same set of columns for each patient.
- The search bar is always visible and accessible.
- The navigation bar must be present for consistent user experience.

**No Edit/Delete:**  
- There are no options for editing or deleting patients from this page.

**No Pagination:**  
- All matching patients are displayed in a single table, regardless of the number of records.

## 5. Dependencies and Relationships

**Internal Dependencies:**
- **DatabaseConnection**: A custom class used to initialize the database connection.
- **JDBC**: Uses Java SQL classes (`Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`) for database operations.

**External Dependencies:**
- **CSS/JS Libraries:**  
    - Bootstrap (for styling and responsive layout)
    - Font Awesome (for icons)
    - jQuery and Popper.js (for Bootstrap JS functionality)
    - Custom CSS files: `adddataform.css`, `adddatafrm1.css`, `table.css`
- **Images:**  
    - Uses images for branding and background (`img/Medical.jpg`, `img/2855.jpeg`).

**Relationships:**
- **Navigation:**  
    - Linked to `addpatient.jsp` (Add Patient page)
    - Linked to `index.jsp` (Home page)
    - Linked to billing pages (Add/View Bill, though these are placeholders in the code)
- **Database Table:**  
    - Relies on the structure of the `patient` table in the database, which must have at least 9 columns corresponding to the displayed fields.

## Additional Notes

- **Security:** The current implementation is vulnerable to SQL injection due to direct string concatenation in the SQL query.
- **Scalability:** No pagination means performance may degrade with a large number of patient records.
- **Accessibility:** Uses Bootstrap for responsive design, but accessibility features are not explicitly addressed.
- **Extensibility:** The page can be extended to support more features like edit/delete, pagination, or advanced search.

**In summary:**  
`listPatient.jsp` is a JSP page that provides a searchable, tabular view of patient records for a hospital management system. It allows users to search patients by name and view their details, leveraging a database backend and standard web technologies for presentation and navigation.
