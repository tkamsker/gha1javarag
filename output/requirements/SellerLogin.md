# Requirements Analysis: WebContent/SellerLogin.html

WebContent/SellerLogin.html
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The SellerLogin.html file provides a dedicated login interface for sellers on the Book Store platform. It allows sellers to access their accounts using their credentials, enabling them to manage their products, orders, and other seller-specific functionalities.

### 2. User Interactions
- Sellers enter their email address and password into the respective fields.
- They click the "Login" button to submit the form.
- Upon successful authentication, sellers are redirected to a seller-specific dashboard or management page.
- If login fails due to incorrect credentials, an error message is displayed.

### 3. Data Handling
- The form collects seller input (email and password) and sends it to a server-side script for validation.
- The server verifies the credentials against the database of registered sellers.
- Upon successful validation, session data may be created to maintain the seller's logged-in state.

### 4. Business Rules
- Sellers must provide valid email and password combinations to log in.
- If login attempts fail, sellers are notified with an appropriate message.
- The system enforces security measures such as rate-limiting or account lockouts after multiple failed attempts (if applicable).

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Relies on server-side scripts to process the login request.
- Depends on a database to store and retrieve seller credentials.
- Integrates with other pages such as the seller dashboard or product management page for post-login navigation.
