# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/bean/ReportingWhitelist.java

ReportingWhitelist.java
1. Purpose: A utility class for GWT RPC (Remote Procedure Call) whitelisting
2. Functionality: 
- Enables whitelisting of classes used in reporting that aren't explicitly defined
- Helps GWT determine which classes to include when handling Object types in reporting
3. Data handling:
- Acts as a registration mechanism for classes needed in reporting
4. Business rules:
- Classes must be explicitly whitelisted to be available for GWT RPC serialization
5. Dependencies:
- GWT RPC system
- Report-related classes
