# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/com/bittercode/constant/db/BooksDBConstants.java

BooksDBConstants.java
### Purpose and Functionality:
This interface defines constants for the database table `books` and its columns (`name`, `barcode`, `author`, `price`, `quantity`). It standardizes access to the books data structure.

### User Interactions:
No direct user interaction as it's a constant definition file. However, it underpins functionalities like book management where users interact via UI/UX elements.

### Data Handling:
Manages the structure of book-related data in the database, ensuring consistent reference across the application.

### Business Rules:
- `barcode` must be unique.
- `price` should be positive.
- `quantity` must be non-negative.

### Dependencies and Relationships:
Depends on other components like DAO classes for database operations. It's related to entities using book data, such as inventory management or sales modules.
