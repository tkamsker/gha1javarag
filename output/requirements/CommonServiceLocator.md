CommonServiceLocator.java
1. Purpose: Acts as a centralized service locator for various GWT service clients in the administration UI

3. Data handling: Manages static instances of service clients
4. Business rules: 
   - Singleton pattern for service instances
   - Lazy initialization of services
5. Dependencies:
   - GWT core framework
   - Multiple service interfaces (SystemTracking, UserRole, Service, UnknownAreaCode, VIPHistory)
