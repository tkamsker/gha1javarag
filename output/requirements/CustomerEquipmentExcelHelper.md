CustomerEquipmentExcelHelper.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Handles Excel file operations for customer equipment data
- Generates Excel reports/exports
- Formats equipment data for Excel output

2. User interactions:
- Indirectly supports user export functionality
- Creates downloadable Excel files

3. Data handling:
- Uses Apache POI for Excel manipulation
- Processes equipment data into Excel format
- Handles output stream operations

4. Business rules:
- Implements Excel formatting rules
- Manages data presentation logic
- Handles date formatting

5. Dependencies:
- Apache POI library
- Apache Commons Lang (FastDateFormat)
- Java IO
- Internal data structures (ArrayList, HashMap)
- Likely depends on other equipment-related services

The system appears to be part of a customer equipment management solution with features for data processing, caching, and Excel report generation. The architecture follows a service-oriented pattern with clear separation of concerns between main service implementation, helper functions, and Excel export capabilities.
