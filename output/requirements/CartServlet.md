# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/CartServlet.java

CartServlet.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `CartServlet` manages the shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add items, remove items, and update item quantities. It handles both GET and POST requests to modify the cart contents and display the current state of the cart.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- Users can add items to their cart from product pages.
- Users can adjust item quantities or remove items directly from the cart page.
- The servlet displays the updated cart contents after each modification.

### 3. Data Handling
- Retrieves the cart from the user's session; if none exists, initializes a new cart.
- Adds/removes items based on request parameters (e.g., `itemID`).
- Updates item quantities as specified by the user.
- Calculates subtotal and total price of items in the cart.

### 4. Business Rules
- Items must exist in the inventory before being added to the cart.
- Item quantities cannot exceed available stock.
- The cart persists across sessions until the user checks out or clears it.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- `HttpSession` for storing the cart between requests.
- Database access for retrieving product details (e.g., price, availability).
- Constants from `BookStoreConstants` for configuration values.
