# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/chart/ChartMetaData.java

ChartMetaData.java

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Stores metadata associated with chart images
- Manages image mapping information
- Provides hash-based identification

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions, serves as metadata container

3. Data handling:
- Stores imageMap data
- Maintains imageMapId for identification
- Stores hash value for verification/tracking
- Implements Serializable for data transfer

4. Business rules:
- Requires imageMapId, imageMap, and hash for full initialization
- Must maintain serializable state

5. Dependencies:
- Implements Serializable
- Part of chart DTO package
- Works in conjunction with Chart and ChartOptions classes

Common Relationships:
- All three classes are part of the same DTO package for chart handling
- They work together to provide complete chart functionality:
  * Chart: Main chart object
  * ChartOptions: Configuration settings
  * ChartMetaData: Supporting metadata
- They share common properties like imageMapId for coordination
