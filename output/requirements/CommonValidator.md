# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/validator/CommonValidator.java

CommonValidator.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Provides common validation utilities
- Centralized validation helper methods
- Reusable validation logic

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Utility class used by other validators

3. Data handling:
- Static utility methods
- String manipulation and checking
- No data storage

4. Business rules:
- Contains methods for:
  - Checking for digits-only strings
  - String length validation
  - String emptiness checking
  - Generic validation rules

5. Dependencies:
- Core dependency for other validators
- No external dependencies
- Used by AONNumberValidator and CityValidator

Additional Notes:
- The validation framework appears to be part of a larger system (cuco-core)
- Follows a modular design with separate validators for different purposes
- Common validation logic is centralized in CommonValidator
- Validation rules are relatively simple and focused on string properties
