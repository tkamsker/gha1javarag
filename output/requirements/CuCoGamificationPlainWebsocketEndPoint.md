# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/CuCoGamificationPlainWebsocketEndPoint.java

CuCoGamificationPlainWebsocketEndPoint.java

1. Purpose and functionality:
- WebSocket endpoint implementation for gamification features
- Handles real-time communication
- Manages secure connections using KeyStore

2. User interactions:
- Provides WebSocket communication endpoint
- Likely supports real-time gamification updates

3. Data handling:
- Uses concurrent data structures (ConcurrentHashMap)
- Manages file operations (FileInputStream)
- Handles socket connections (InetSocketAddress)

4. Business rules:
- Implements secure communication protocols
- Manages concurrent access to shared resources
- Handles temporal data (Calendar)

5. Dependencies and relationships:
- Depends on Java security infrastructure
- Uses concurrent utilities
- Integrates with file system
- Part of the gamification subsystem

Note: Analysis based on visible imports and file structure. Full implementation details would provide more comprehensive requirements.
