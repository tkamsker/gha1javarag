# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/CustomerRegisterServlet.java

src/main/java/servlets/CustomerRegisterServlet.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality  
This servlet handles customer registration requests. It processes HTTP POST requests containing customer registration data (e.g., username, password, email), validates the input, interacts with the database via `DBUtil`, and redirects to appropriate pages based on success or failure.

### 2. User Interactions  
- Receives form data from a registration page.
- Validates user inputs (e.g., checking for duplicate usernames).
- Redirects users to a success page upon successful registration or displays error messages if registration fails.

### 3. Data Handling  
- Reads input parameters from the HTTP request.
- Writes output to the response using `PrintWriter`.
- Uses `DBUtil` to interact with the database, likely inserting new customer records.

### 4. Business Rules  
- Ensure all required fields (username, password, email) are provided.
- Validate username uniqueness in the database.
- Encrypt passwords before storing them in the database.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships  
- Depends on `DBUtil` for database operations.
- Uses constants from `BookStoreConstants` and `ResponseCode`.
- Relies on `DatabaseConfig` indirectly via `DBUtil` for database configuration.
