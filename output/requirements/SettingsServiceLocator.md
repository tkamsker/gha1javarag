# Requirements Analysis: administration.ui/src/main/java/at/a1ta/webclient/cucosett/client/service/SettingsServiceLocator.java

SettingsServiceLocator.java
1. Purpose: Service locator pattern implementation for managing various service endpoints
2. User Interactions:
- No direct user interactions (service layer)
3. Data Handling:
- Manages service instances for:
  - Credit type services
  - Charging type services
  - Team services
  - Authentication services
  - IBatis services
4. Business Rules:
- Singleton pattern for service instances
- Service initialization and access controls
5. Dependencies:
- GWT core
- Various service interfaces (CreditTypeServlet, ChargingTypeServlet, etc.)
- Authentication services
- Database services (IBatis)

Key Integration Points:
- TeamServiceManagementPanel and TeamManagementPanel likely consume services provided by SettingsServiceLocator
- Service layer provides separation between UI and backend services
- Consistent authentication and authorization across services
