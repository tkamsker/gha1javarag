# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/BANCollection.java

BANCollection.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Manages collections of Billing Account Numbers (BANs) associated with a party
- Implements Serializable for data transfer

2. User interactions:
- Provides methods to manage BAN collections
- Allows retrieval and modification of BANs for a party

3. Data handling:
- Stores party identifier (partyId)
- Maintains ArrayList of BillingAccountNumber objects
- Supports serialization for data transfer

4. Business rules:
- BANs are associated with a specific party ID
- Multiple BANs can be associated with a single party
- Collection must be serializable for system operations

5. Dependencies:
- BillingAccountNumber class
- ArrayList from Java Collections
- Serializable interface

These classes appear to be part of a larger billing or customer management system, with clear separation of concerns between party management, product inventory, and billing account handling.
