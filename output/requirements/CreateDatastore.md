# Requirements Analysis: setup/CreateDatastore.sql

setup/CreateDatastore.sql
1. **Purpose and Functionality**: This SQL script creates a database named `onlinebookstore` and defines two tables: `books` and `users`. The `books` table stores book details, while the `users` table manages user accounts.
2. **User Interactions**: Users interact with this data indirectly through application interfaces (e.g., login forms, shopping pages).
3. **Data Handling**: 
   - Books are stored with barcode as the primary key, including name, author, price, and quantity.
   - Users are stored with username as the primary key, along with password, personal details, and contact information.
4. **Business Rules**:
   - Each book must have a unique barcode.
   - User passwords must be non-null to ensure security.
5. **Dependencies and Relationships**: This script is executed during database setup and serves as the foundation for other application components that interact with the database.
