# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/GamificationMessageComparator.java

GamificationMessageComparator.java
1. Purpose: Implements a comparator for sorting GamificationMessage objects by timestamp in descending order (newest first)
2. User Interactions: None - utility class
3. Data Handling:
   - Compares two GamificationMessage objects using their timestamp values
   - Implements Serializable for object persistence
4. Business Rules:
   - Messages should be sorted in reverse chronological order
   - Handles null values safely through try-catch
5. Dependencies:
   - Depends on GamificationMessage class
   - Implements Comparator interface
   - Implements Serializable interface
