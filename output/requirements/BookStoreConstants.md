# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/com/bittercode/constant/BookStoreConstants.java

src/main/java/com/bittercode/constant/BookStoreConstants.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
- The `BookStoreConstants` interface defines constants related to content types used in the Book Store application.
- It provides predefined values for MIME types such as `CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT_HTML`.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- Users interact with the system through web pages or API endpoints that use these content types.
- The constants ensure consistent handling of different content types across the application.

### 3. Data Handling
- Does not directly handle data but provides constants for configuring HTTP responses.
- Ensures that the correct MIME type is set when serving content to users.

### 4. Business Rules
- The application must serve content with appropriate MIME types to ensure proper rendering by clients (e.g., browsers).
- Consistent use of content types improves compatibility and user experience.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Minimal dependencies; primarily defines string constants.
- Used by other components when setting response headers or configuring content delivery.
