### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `Cart` class manages a shopping cart, tracking which books are added along with their quantities. It allows users to add, modify, or remove items from their cart.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
Users interact by adding books to their cart, adjusting quantities, and removing items. This is typically done through the application's user interface, which interacts with services handling cart operations.

### 3. Data Handling
The class stores a `Book` object and an integer quantity. It includes methods for getting and setting these values, ensuring data consistency.

### 4. Business Rules
- Quantity must not exceed the book's available stock.
- The cart should validate that a book is in stock before allowing it to be added.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
The `Cart` class depends on the `Book` class to reference specific books. It may interact with services for updating quantities or checking stock availability.
