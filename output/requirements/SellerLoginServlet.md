# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/servlets/SellerLoginServlet.java

src/main/java/servlets/SellerLoginServlet.java
### Purpose and Functionality:
The SellerLoginServlet handles the login process for sellers. It authenticates seller credentials, validates them against stored data, and manages session creation upon successful authentication.

### User Interactions:
- Sellers enter their username and password on a login form.
- Upon submission, the servlet checks the credentials.
- If valid, the seller is redirected to the dashboard; if invalid, an error message is displayed.

### Data Handling:
- Retrieves seller data from the database using constants for user-related fields (e.g., username, password).
- Processes form parameters submitted by the seller.
- Validates the input against stored credentials and manages session attributes upon successful login.

### Business Rules:
- Ensure that both username and password are provided before attempting validation.
- Check if the seller exists in the database and has valid credentials.
- Set appropriate session variables (e.g., role, user ID) for subsequent requests.

### Dependencies and Relationships:
- Relies on UserDAO or similar classes for database interactions.
- Uses constants from BookStoreConstants and UsersDBConstants for field names and response codes.
- Depends on the login form JSP and dashboard JSP pages for rendering.
