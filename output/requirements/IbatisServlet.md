# Requirements Analysis: administration.ui/src/main/java/at/a1ta/webclient/cucosett/client/service/IbatisServlet.java

IbatisServlet.java
1. Purpose: Synchronous service interface for iBATIS database operations
2. User Interactions: None directly - defines service contract
3. Data Handling:
   - Defines methods for DAO management
   - Returns ArrayList of DAO names
   - Returns RpcStatus for operation results
4. Business Rules:
   - Mapped to "cuco/ibatis.rpc" endpoint
   - Extends RemoteService for GWT RPC functionality
5. Dependencies:
   - GWT RemoteService
   - RpcStatus DTO
   - Paired with asynchronous interface (IbatisServletAsync)
   - RemoteServiceRelativePath annotation for endpoint mapping

Common Patterns:
- All files are part of GWT client-server communication infrastructure
- Follow GWT RPC pattern with async/sync interface pairs
- Focus on data access and system administration functionality
- Use DTOs for data transfer
- Located in administration.ui module
