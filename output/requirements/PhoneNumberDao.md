# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/PhoneNumberDao.java

PhoneNumberDao.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Data access interface for managing phone number related operations
- Handles queries and operations related to phone numbers and their associated data
- Part of the core data access layer for the CUCO system

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions as this is a DAO interface
- Serves as backend support for higher-level services that handle user requests

3. Data handling:
- Manages PhoneNumber entities
- Handles BillingAccountNumber associations
- Processes PhoneNumberStructure data
- Deals with MobileChurnLikeliness information
- Supports filtering through ProductDetailFilter

4. Business rules:
- Must maintain relationships between phone numbers and billing accounts
- Handles phone number structure validation and storage
- Supports churn likelihood tracking for mobile numbers
- Implements product-specific filtering capabilities

5. Dependencies and relationships:
- Depends on multiple DTOs:
  - PhoneNumber
  - BillingAccountNumber
  - MobileChurnLikeliness
  - PhoneNumberStructure
  - ProductDetailFilter
- Likely integrated with other DAOs for complete business operations
- Returns List collections of PhoneNumber objects

Note: For a more comprehensive analysis of LocationDao.java and InvoiceDao.java, access to their actual interface definitions would be required.
