# Requirements Analysis: src/java/Controller/AddWorker.java

Certainly! Here is a detailed requirements analysis for the Java source file `src/java/Controller/AddWorker.java`:

---

## 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Purpose:**  
The `AddWorker` servlet is designed to handle HTTP POST requests for adding a new worker to the system. It processes form data submitted by an administrator (or authorized user), inserts the worker's information into a database, and provides feedback to the user about the success or failure of the operation.

**Functionality:**  
- Receives worker details (first name, last name, mobile number) from an HTML form.
- Captures the current date and time as the registration timestamp.
- Inserts the new worker's data into the `worker` database table.
- Provides immediate feedback to the user via JavaScript alerts and redirects them to the appropriate page based on the result.

---

## 2. User Interactions

**Actors:**  
- **Administrator** (or any user with permission to add workers)

**Interactions:**  
- The user fills out a form (presumably on `AddWorker.jsp`) with the following fields:
  - First Name (`fname`)
  - Last Name (`lname`)
  - Mobile Number (`Mobile`)
- Upon submitting the form, a POST request is sent to `/AddWorker`.
- The servlet processes the request and:
  - If successful, shows an alert "Add Successfully..!" and redirects to `AdminHome.jsp`.
  - If unsuccessful, shows an alert "Incorrect Data..!" and redirects back to `AddWorker.jsp`.

---

## 3. Data Handling

**Input Data:**
- `fname` (First Name): String, from request parameter.
- `lname` (Last Name): String, from request parameter.
- `Mobile` (Mobile Number): String, from request parameter.
- `DateAndTime`: String, generated by the server as the current date and time in `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss` format.

**Processing:**
- The servlet retrieves the parameters from the request.
- The current date and time are formatted as a string.
- A database connection is established.
- A prepared SQL statement is used to insert the data into the `worker` table.

**Output Data:**
- A new row in the `worker` table with the provided data.
- JavaScript alert and redirection in the user's browser.

**Error Handling:**
- If the database operation fails, an error is logged and the user is notified with an alert.

---

## 4. Business Rules

- **Mandatory Fields:** All three fields (`fname`, `lname`, `Mobile`) must be provided. (Note: The code does not explicitly validate for empty fields, but the database may enforce NOT NULL constraints.)
- **Timestamp:** Each worker record must include the date and time of registration.
- **Uniqueness:** The code does not enforce uniqueness of the mobile number or any other field; this is assumed to be handled at the database level if required.
- **Feedback:** The user must be notified of the result (success or failure) of the operation immediately after submission.
- **Redirection:** On success, redirect to the admin home page; on failure, redirect back to the add worker form.

---

## 5. Dependencies and Relationships

**Dependencies:**
- **Servlet API:** Extends `HttpServlet`, uses `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, and servlet annotations.
- **Database Layer:** Uses a custom `DatabaseConnection` class to initialize the database connection.
- **JDBC:** Uses `Connection`, `PreparedStatement`, and `SQLException` for database operations.
- **Logging:** Uses Java's `Logger` for error logging.
- **Date Formatting:** Uses `Date`, `DateFormat`, and `SimpleDateFormat` for timestamp generation.

**Relationships:**
- **Database:** Interacts with the `worker` table in the database. The structure of this table is assumed to match the four fields inserted.
- **Front-end Pages:** 
  - `AddWorker.jsp`: The form page for adding a worker.
  - `AdminHome.jsp`: The landing page after a successful addition.
- **Other Controllers:** The error logging references `AddPatient.class`, which may be a copy-paste error and should likely reference `AddWorker.class`.

|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**        | Add a new worker to the system via a web form.                          |
| **User**           | Administrator (or authorized user)                                      |
| **Input**          | First Name, Last Name, Mobile Number                                    |
| **Processing**     | Insert into `worker` table with current timestamp                       |
| **Output**         | Success/failure alert and redirection                                   |
| **Business Rules** | All fields required, timestamp recorded, immediate feedback             |
| **Dependencies**   | Servlet API, JDBC, DatabaseConnection, Logger, Date/Time utilities      |
| **Related Pages**  | `AddWorker.jsp`, `AdminHome.jsp`                                        |
| **Error Handling** | Logs errors, notifies user on failure                                   |

**Note:**  
- The code could be improved by adding input validation, better error handling, and using request dispatchers instead of JavaScript for navigation.
- The database schema for the `worker` table is assumed to match the four fields inserted.
