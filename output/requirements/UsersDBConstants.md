# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/com/bittercode/constant/db/UsersDBConstants.java

UsersDBConstants.java
### Purpose and Functionality:
Defines constants for the `users` table columns (`username`, `password`, etc.), standardizing user data access.

### User Interactions:
Indirect through user registration/login, where fields like username and password are used. It supports user management features accessed via UI/UX.

### Data Handling:
Structures user-related data in the database, ensuring consistent reference across the application.

### Business Rules:
- `username` must be unique.
- `password` should meet complexity requirements (e.g., length, special characters).

### Dependencies and Relationships:
Depends on DAO classes for database operations. Related to authentication/authorization modules and user profile management.
