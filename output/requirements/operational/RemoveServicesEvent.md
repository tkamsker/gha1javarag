RemoveServicesEvent.java
1. Purpose: Represents an event for removing a service from the system
2. Functionality:
- Extends PortletEvent base class
- Handles the removal of a single service
3. Data handling:
- Manages a single Service object
- Provides getter/setter for service

5. Dependencies:

3. Service operations must maintain data consistency
4. The system should support both bulk addition and single removal of services
5. All events must be associated with appropriate event types from CuCoEventType
