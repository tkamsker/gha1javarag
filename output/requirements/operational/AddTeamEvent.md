AddTeamEvent.java
1. Purpose: Event handler for adding new teams to the system
2. User Interactions: Triggered when creating a new team
3. Data Handling:
   - Manages Team objects
   - Provides getter/setter methods for team property
4. Business Rules:
   - Extends PortletEvent for event handling
   - Uses CuCoEventType.UPDATE for event type
   - Must contain valid Team data
5. Dependencies:
   - at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.dto.Team
   - at.a1ta.framework.ui.client.event.PortletEvent

Common Patterns:
- All three files are part of the event handling system
- They all extend PortletEvent
- They follow a similar pattern of managing specific data types (UnknownAreaCode, BiteUser, Team)
- They are part of the administration UI module
- They implement event-driven architecture for user interface updates
