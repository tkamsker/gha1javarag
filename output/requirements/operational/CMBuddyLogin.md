CMBuddyLogin.java
1. Purpose: Authentication data transfer object for login credentials
2. User Interactions:
- Login form data capture
- Authentication requests
3. Data Handling:
- Stores username and password credentials
- Implements Serializable for secure transfer
- Version control via serialVersionUID
4. Business Rules:
- Username and password are required for authentication
- Credentials must be securely transmitted
5. Dependencies:
- Java Serializable interface
- Used by authentication/security services
- Likely integrated with login UI components

These DTOs appear to be part of a larger customer management or support system, with clear separation of concerns between user statistics, support unit management, and authentication.
