ProductgroupEvent.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Manages product group-related events
- Handles product group insertions and updates
- Extends PortletEvent for product group operations

2. User interactions:
- Triggered during product group creation or modification
- Supports three update types: insert, update, and none

3. Data handling:
- Manages ProductGroup objects
- Tracks update type for each operation
- Uses PortletEvent system for event handling

4. Business rules:
- Requires valid ProductGroup object
- Must specify appropriate UpdateType
- Maintains product group data integrity

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on CuCo core DTOs
- Integrated with PortletEvent framework
- Uses custom UpdateType enumeration

All three files are part of an administrative UI system, sharing common event handling patterns and extending PortletEvent. They follow similar architectural patterns but handle different business entities (team members, roles, and product groups).
