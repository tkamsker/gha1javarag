# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/com/bittercode/constant/ResponseCode.java

src/main/java/com/bittercode/constant/ResponseCode.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
- The `ResponseCode` enum defines standard HTTP status codes and corresponding messages for consistent error handling across the application.
- It provides predefined response codes such as SUCCESS, FAILURE, PAGE_NOT_FOUND, ACCESS_DENIED, etc.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- Users interact with the system through web requests or API calls.
- The response codes are used to communicate the outcome of these interactions, providing feedback on whether an operation was successful or if there were errors.

### 3. Data Handling
- Does not directly handle data but provides constants for constructing HTTP responses.
- Ensures that error messages and status codes are standardized across the application.

### 4. Business Rules
- The application must return consistent HTTP status codes and messages to users.
- Standardized response handling improves user experience and simplifies debugging.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Minimal dependencies; primarily uses Java's `enum` type and utility classes like `Arrays`.
- Used by other components of the application when constructing responses to client requests.
