# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/ReadOnlyStatusBasedOnCategory.java

ReadOnlyStatusBasedOnCategory.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Enum defining access permissions based on categories
- Provides two states: EDITABLE and READ_ONLY
- Controls data access permissions

2. Business rules:
- Binary permission model:
  - EDITABLE: Allows modifications
  - READ_ONLY: Restricts to view-only access
- Category-based access control

3. Dependencies:
- Used by other components to determine access rights
- Part of permission/security framework
- Integrated with category-based business logic

4. Data handling:
- Simple enum implementation
- No complex data structures
- Stateless design

The system appears to be part of a quote management system with role-based access control and profile management capabilities. The components work together to manage permissions, configurations, and user profiles in a business context.
