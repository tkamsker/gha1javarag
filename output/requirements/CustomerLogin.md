# Requirements Analysis: WebContent/CustomerLogin.html

WebContent/CustomerLogin.html
### 1. Purpose and Functionality  
This HTML file serves as a login page for customers to access their accounts on the bookstore website. It provides a user interface for entering credentials (username/email and password) and authenticating access to personalized features such as order history, wish lists, and account settings.

### 2. User Interactions  
- Users can enter their username or email address in a text field.
- Users can enter their password in a secure text field.
- Users click a "Login" button to submit their credentials.
- Optional links for "Forgot Password," "Create Account," or "Register" may be present to assist users who need help accessing their accounts.

### 3. Data Handling  
- The page collects user input (username/email and password) and sends it securely to the backend server for authentication.
- Input validation is performed to ensure required fields are filled out correctly.
- Secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is essential to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.

### 4. Business Rules  
- Users must provide valid credentials to log in successfully.
- Failed login attempts should display appropriate error messages (e.g., "Invalid username or password").
- Upon successful login, users are redirected to their account dashboard or a specified page.
- Session management ensures user authentication state is maintained across subsequent interactions.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships  
- Relies on backend services for user authentication and session management.
- Depends on a database to store and validate user credentials.
- May depend on CSS frameworks or external libraries (e.g., Bootstrap) for styling and layout.
- Related to other pages such as the homepage, account creation page, password reset page, and application logic for handling login requests.
