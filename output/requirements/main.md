# Requirements Analysis: web/js/main.js

Certainly! Here is a detailed requirements analysis for the provided JavaScript file (`web/js/main.js`):

---

## 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Purpose:**  
This JavaScript file is designed to enhance the user experience and enforce validation rules on a web form, likely a contact or registration form. It provides real-time feedback to users as they interact with input fields and ensures that form submissions meet certain validation criteria before being processed.

**Functionality Overview:**
- Adds/removes visual cues to input fields based on user interaction (focus/blur).
- Validates form fields on submission, especially email fields.
- Displays or hides validation error indicators dynamically.

---

## 2. User Interactions

**a. Input Focus and Blur:**
- When a user leaves (blurs) an input field with the class `.input100`, the script checks if the field is not empty.
    - If not empty, it adds the class `has-val` to the input (likely for styling purposes, e.g., floating labels).
    - If empty, it removes the `has-val` class.

**b. Form Submission:**
- When the user submits a form with the class `.validate-form`, the script:
    - Iterates over all `.input100` fields within `.validate-input` containers.
    - Validates each field (see validation logic below).
    - If any field fails validation, it prevents form submission and visually marks the invalid fields.

**c. Input Focus (after validation error):**
- When a user focuses on an input field that previously failed validation, the script removes the error indicator, allowing the user to correct their input.

---

## 3. Data Handling

**a. Input Values:**
- The script reads the value of each input field on blur and on form submission.
- For email fields, it uses a regular expression to check for valid email format.
- For other fields, it checks that the value is not empty (after trimming whitespace).

**b. Validation State:**
- The script uses CSS classes (`has-val`, `alert-validate`) to track and display the state of each input field:
    - `has-val`: Indicates the field has a value.
    - `alert-validate`: Indicates the field failed validation.

**c. No Data Storage:**
- The script does not store or transmit data; it only reads and reacts to user input in real time.

---

## 4. Business Rules

**a. Required Fields:**
- All fields with the class `.input100` are required; they must not be empty.

**b. Email Validation:**
- Any field with `type="email"` or `name="email"` must match a specific email regex pattern.
- If the email does not match the pattern, the field is considered invalid.

**c. Visual Feedback:**
- Fields that fail validation are visually marked (likely with a red border or error message via the `alert-validate` class).
- When the user focuses on an invalid field, the error indicator is removed, allowing for correction.

**d. Form Submission:**
- The form will only submit if all `.input100` fields pass validation.
- If any field fails, submission is blocked.

---

## 5. Dependencies and Relationships

**a. jQuery Dependency:**
- The script is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) that takes `jQuery` as a parameter, indicating a dependency on the jQuery library.
- All DOM manipulations and event handling use jQuery methods.

**b. CSS Classes:**
- Relies on specific CSS classes (`input100`, `validate-input`, `validate-form`, `has-val`, `alert-validate`) for both selection and visual feedback.
- The presence and styling of these classes in the CSS are essential for the script to function as intended.

**c. HTML Structure:**
- Assumes a specific HTML structure:
    - Input fields have the class `.input100`.
    - Inputs are wrapped in a parent with `.validate-input`.
    - The form has the class `.validate-form`.

**d. No External Data/API:**
- The script does not interact with any external data sources or APIs.

| **User Interactions** | Input focus/blur, form submission, error correction                     |
| **Data Handling**     | Reads input values, uses CSS classes for state, no data storage         |
| **Business Rules**    | Required fields, email format validation, block invalid submissions     |
| **Dependencies**      | jQuery, specific CSS classes, HTML structure                            |

## Conclusion

This JavaScript file implements client-side form validation and user feedback for a web form. It ensures that all required fields are filled and that email addresses are in a valid format before allowing submission. The script is dependent on jQuery and specific CSS/HTML conventions. Its primary goal is to improve user experience and data integrity by preventing incomplete or incorrectly formatted submissions.
