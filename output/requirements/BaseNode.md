# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/product/BaseNode.java

BaseNode.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Implements hierarchical node structure for contract/product management
- Supports tree-like data organization
- Manages parent-child relationships between nodes

2. User interactions:
- Supports view-related depth calculations
- Manages node visibility and structure

3. Data handling:
- Stores node ID, contract segment
- Maintains parent reference and child collection
- Tracks depth and effective depth for view
- Manages children visibility

4. Business rules:
- Nodes must maintain proper parent-child relationships
- Depth calculations must be accurate
- Contract segments must be properly managed

5. Dependencies and relationships:
- Implements Node interface
- Uses IndexationStatus
- Contains ArrayList of BaseNode children
- Self-referential structure through parent property
