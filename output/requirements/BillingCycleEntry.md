# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/BillingCycleEntry.java

BillingCycleEntry.java
1. Purpose: Represents a billing cycle record with temporal and identification data
2. Data handling:
   - Serializable DTO for data transfer
   - Contains fields for:
     - id (Long)
     - vBlock (String)
     - column (int)
     - step (String)
     - from, to, hr (Date objects)
   - Standard getter/setter methods
3. Business rules:
   - Tracks billing cycle periods with start/end dates
   - Includes hierarchical organization (vBlock, column, step)
   - Maintains history record (hr field)
4. Dependencies:
   - Java Serializable interface
   - Java Date utility
   - Used in billing/invoicing components

Common Patterns:
- All classes follow DTO pattern
- Implement Serializable for data transfer
- Use standard Java bean conventions
- Focus on data encapsulation with getter/setter methods
