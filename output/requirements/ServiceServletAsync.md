# Requirements Analysis: administration.ui/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/admin/ui/common/client/service/ServiceServletAsync.java

ServiceServletAsync.java
1. Purpose: Asynchronous interface for service management operations
2. User Interactions:
   - Deletes services by ID
   - Retrieves all services
3. Data Handling:
   - Works with Service DTOs
   - Returns RpcStatus for operations
   - Uses ArrayList for collections
4. Business Rules:
   - Service CRUD operations
   - Likely includes validation for service deletion
5. Dependencies:
   - GWT User RPC
   - Core shared DTO classes
   - Framework UI client DTOs (RpcStatus)

Common Patterns Across Files:
- All use GWT's AsyncCallback pattern for asynchronous operations
- Part of administration UI module
- Follow similar interface design patterns
- Use shared DTOs and framework components
- Implement client-side service interfaces
