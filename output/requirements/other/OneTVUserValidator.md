OneTVUserValidator.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Validates user identifiers for OneTV system
- Implements pattern-based validation
- Supports flexible validation patterns

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interface
- Used as a backend validation component

3. Data handling:
- Accepts two string parameters:
  - Value to validate
  - Pattern to validate against
- Returns boolean validation result

4. Business rules:
- Validates input against provided regex pattern
- Empty/null values are considered valid
- Pattern matching must be exact

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on CommonValidator for blank checking
- Relies on Java regex functionality
- Used in OneTV user management system

Note: All three validators appear to be part of a larger validation framework, with CommonValidator serving as a shared utility class. The implementation suggests a modular approach to validation with specific validators for different data types and business needs.
