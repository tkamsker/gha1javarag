ChartMetaData.java

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Stores metadata associated with chart images
- Manages image mapping information
- Provides hash-based identification

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions, serves as metadata container

3. Data handling:
- Stores imageMap data
- Maintains imageMapId for identification
- Stores hash value for verification/tracking
- Implements Serializable for data transfer

4. Business rules:
- Requires unique imageMapId
- Must maintain hash value for integrity
- Supports metadata initialization through constructor

5. Dependencies:
- Implements Serializable
- Works in conjunction with Chart and ChartOptions classes

These three classes form a cohesive system for managing chart generation, configuration, and metadata handling in the application. They work together to provide a complete chart management solution with proper data transfer capabilities and configuration options.
