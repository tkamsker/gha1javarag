RPCServiceAsync.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Defines an asynchronous RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service interface
- Handles execution of actions and returns results asynchronously
- Part of a command pattern implementation for client-server communication

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Serves as infrastructure for handling async operations

3. Data handling:
- Processes generic Action<T> objects
- Returns Results via AsyncCallback mechanism
- Uses generics for type safety

4. Business rules:
- Must handle any Action type that extends Result
- Follows GWT's async pattern requirements

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on GWT's AsyncCallback
- Uses custom dispatch Action and Result interfaces
- Core component of the framework's RPC architecture
