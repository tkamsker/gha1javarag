SecurityBase.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Provides base security configuration for digital selling platform
- Implements core security-related functionality
- Handles security settings and parameters

2. Data handling:
- Implements Serializable for object persistence
- Uses XML binding for data structure
- Handles boolean flags for internal settings
- Uses BigDecimal for precise numerical values

3. Business rules:
- Must maintain security-related configurations
- Requires proper serialization handling
- Serves as base class for security implementations

4. Dependencies:
- Implements Serializable interface
- Uses javax.xml.bind annotations
- Requires BigDecimal for calculations
- Acts as a base class for other security-related implementations

Common Patterns:
- All classes use XML binding annotations
- Follow inheritance patterns for specialized functionality
- Part of digital selling module in the cuco-core system
- Implement Serializable for object persistence
- Use standardized data types for consistency
