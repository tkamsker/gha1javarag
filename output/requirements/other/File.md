**File Type:** Java source file

File.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents file entities in the system
- Manages file metadata and MIME type information
- Provides file type categorization through enumeration

2. User interactions:
- Supports file handling operations
- Enables file type identification and validation

3. Data handling:
- Implements Serializable for object persistence
- Defines supported MIME types through enumeration
- Maintains version control with serialVersionUID

4. Business rules:
- Supports specific file formats (PNG, CSV, PDF, XLS, XLSX, XML)
- Each file type has associated MIME type specification
- Standardized file type handling

5. Dependencies:
- Implements Serializable interface
- Used by file handling components
- Independent of KeyableBean interface (unlike Reporting)

The system appears to be part of a larger reporting and file management framework, with clear separation of concerns between reporting configuration, entity identification, and file handling capabilities.
