BillingCycle.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents a billing cycle period with associated entries
- Manages billing date and related billing entries
- Serializable for data transfer

2. Data handling:
- Stores billing date (Date object)
- Maintains list of BillingCycleEntry objects
- Implements Serializable interface

3. Business rules:
- Each billing cycle must have a date
- Can contain multiple billing entries
- Must maintain data integrity across serialization

4. Dependencies:
- Java Date utility
- BillingCycleEntry class
- Java Serializable interface
- Likely used by billing and payment processing systems
- May integrate with financial reporting systems

These DTOs appear to be part of a larger customer management and billing system, with clear separation of concerns between customer interactions, product management, and billing processes.
