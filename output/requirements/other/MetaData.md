MetaData.java

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Manages metadata entries in both list and map formats
- Provides a data structure for storing and accessing metadata information
- Implements Serializable for object persistence

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions; serves as a data container

3. Data handling:
- Maintains dual storage: ArrayList and HashMap for metadata entries
- Provides methods to add and retrieve metadata entries
- Ensures synchronized state between list and map storage

4. Business rules:
- Metadata entries must have unique keys in the map
- Both list and map must remain synchronized
- Null entries are likely not permitted (implementation dependent)

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on MetaDataEntry class
- Java Collections Framework (ArrayList, HashMap)
- Serializable interface
