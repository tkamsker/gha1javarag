**File Type:** Java source file

Coordinates.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents geographical coordinates
- Stores longitude and latitude values
- Implements Serializable for data transfer

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions, serves as a data container

3. Data handling:
- Stores longitude and latitude as double values
- Provides getters/setters for coordinate values
- Implements serialization

4. Business rules:
- Coordinates represented as decimal degrees
- Both longitude and latitude required for valid coordinates

5. Dependencies:
- java.io.Serializable
- No other external dependencies

These classes appear to be part of a larger system dealing with contract/product management and user billing, with geographical location support. The BaseNode class seems to be the most complex, forming the backbone of a hierarchical structure, while BillableUser and Coordinates serve as supporting DTOs.
