DefaultSubscriptionType.java
1. Purpose: Defines an enumeration of possible subscription types in the system
2. User Interactions: None directly - used for type classification
3. Data Handling:
   - Enumerated values: Wireline, Mobile, Mixed, Marketplace, BillableUser, Unknown
   - Implements Serializable for data transfer/persistence
4. Business Rules:
   - Represents fixed set of valid subscription types
   - System must use only these predefined types
   - Unknown type provided as fallback
5. Dependencies:
   - Java Serializable interface
   - Likely used by subscription-related classes and business logic

Common Patterns:
- All files are in the same package (at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.dto.product)
- All implement Serializable for data transfer
- Part of a larger product-related DTO structure
- Follow Java bean conventions for property access
