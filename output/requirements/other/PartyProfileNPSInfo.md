PartyProfileNPSInfo.java
1. Purpose: Manages Net Promoter Score (NPS) information for customer profiles
2. User Interactions: None directly - used as a data transfer object
3. Data Handling:
   - Stores scoring type, value, and date
   - Implements Serializable
   - Supports GWT parsing
4. Business Rules:
   - Requires scoring type, value, and date for complete profile
   - Empty constructor required for GWT compatibility
5. Dependencies:
   - GWT framework compatibility
   - Used in customer satisfaction/feedback systems
   - Part of larger party profile management system

All three classes are DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) within the same package (at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.dto) and form part of a customer/contract management system, with each handling specific aspects of customer data.
