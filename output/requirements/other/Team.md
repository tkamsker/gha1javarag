Team.java
1. Purpose: Represents a team entity with members and metadata
2. User interactions:
   - Team creation
   - Member management
   - Team information updates
3. Data handling:
   - Core properties: id, name, description
   - Team membership tracking
   - Creation metadata (creator and date)
   - List of team members
4. Business rules:
   - Teams must have a creator
   - Teams can have multiple members
   - Creation date is tracked
5. Dependencies:
   - Implements Serializable
   - Uses at.a1ta.bite.core.shared.dto.BiteUser
   - Uses Java util classes (ArrayList, Date, List)

All these classes appear to be DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used for data transportation between different layers of the application, with serialization support for network transfer or persistence.
