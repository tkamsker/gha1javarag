# Requirements Analysis: pom.xml

pom.xml
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
- **Purpose**: This XML file is a Maven Project Object Model (POM) configuration file that defines the project's build lifecycle, dependencies, plugins, and other configurations.
- **Functionality**:
  - Manages project dependencies and libraries.
  - Configures build processes (e.g., compiling code, running tests, packaging the application).
  - Specifies project metadata such as groupId, artifactId, and version.

### 2. User Interactions
- **No Direct User Interaction**: This file is used internally by Maven to manage the project's build process and dependencies. It does not directly interact with end-users.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Dependency Management**: Manages external libraries and frameworks required for the project (e.g., servlet API, JSTL).
- **Build Configuration**: Configures how the project is built, including source directories, output directories, and plugins.
- **Versioning**: Specifies the project's version and ensures consistency across builds.

### 4. Business Rules
- **Dependency Versioning**: Ensures that all dependencies are compatible with each other and with the project's requirements.
- **Build Configuration**: Configures the build process to meet the project's specific needs (e.g., packaging as a WAR file for deployment on a servlet container).

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- **External Libraries**: Specifies dependencies such as servlet API, JSTL, and other required libraries.
- **Maven Plugins**: Configures Maven plugins for tasks like compiling code, running tests, and packaging the application.
- **Project Structure**: Defines the project's directory structure and build configuration.
