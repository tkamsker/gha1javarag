# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/InventoryDao.java

InventoryDao.java
1. Purpose: Data access interface for inventory and customer binding management
2. User Interactions:
   - None directly - backend service interface
3. Data Handling:
   - Manages inventory records
   - Handles customer bindings
   - Supports filtered searches
4. Business Rules:
   - Links customers to inventory items
   - Supports filtering by product details
   - Handles multiple customers and contract IDs
5. Dependencies:
   - Uses SearchResult for query responses
   - Handles CustomerBinding entities
   - Integrates with BindingsFilter for search refinement
   - Commented code suggests potential product filtering functionality

Each interface appears to be part of a larger customer management system, with distinct responsibilities for search, access control, and inventory management. The system seems to follow a DAO pattern for data access abstraction.
