**File Type:** XML configuration

sqlmap-billingCycle.xml
1. Purpose and functionality:
- iBatis SQL mapping for billing cycle operations
- Manages billing cycle data and related entries
- Handles billing period and cycle-related database operations

2. Data handling:
- Defines type aliases for BillingCycle and BillingCycleEntry DTOs
- Implements result mapping for billing cycle data
- Likely contains CRUD operations for billing cycles

3. Business rules:
- Separate handling of billing cycles and cycle entries suggests complex billing logic
- Structured approach to billing period management

4. Dependencies:
- Requires iBatis framework
- Depends on BillingCycle and BillingCycleEntry DTOs
- Part of larger billing/invoicing system

Common Requirements Across Files:
1. System must use iBatis for database operations
2. Caching strategy must be implemented for performance optimization
3. Clear separation of concerns between invoice, user, and billing cycle operations
4. DTOs must be properly mapped for data transfer
5. Database operations must be properly mapped and optimized
