- Retrieves subscription information for given call numbers

2. User interactions:

3. Data handling:
- Returns ArrayList of Promotion objects
- Accepts CallNumber as input parameter
- Manages subscription data

4. Business rules:
- One call number can have multiple promotions/subscriptions
- Returns empty list if no promotions exist

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on CallNumber and Promotion DTOs
- Uses Java ArrayList for collection handling

Note: All these services appear to be part of a larger telecommunications system, likely handling customer accounts, promotions, and billing functionality. They follow a service-oriented architecture pattern and are part of the core business logic layer.
