**File Type:** XML configuration

sqlmap-service.xml
1. Purpose and functionality:
- iBatis SQL mapping configuration for Service-related database operations
- Defines data mapping between database and Service DTOs
- Implements caching using ehcache for service data

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions - backend configuration file
- Supports service-related queries used by application logic

3. Data handling:
- Maps Service DTO objects to database tables
- Implements read-only caching for service data
- Likely handles basic CRUD operations for services

4. Business rules:
- Uses read-only cache indicating service data is relatively static
- Cache flush interval suggests periodic data refresh requirements

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on iBatis framework
- References at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.dto.Service class
- Integrates with ehcache caching system
