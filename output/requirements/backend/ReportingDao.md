ReportingDao.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Handles reporting data access operations
- Manages report retrieval and execution
- Supports dynamic report generation

2. User interactions:
- Retrieves individual reports
- Accesses all available reports
- Executes report statements

3. Data handling:
- Works with Reporting beans
- Processes SQL/report statements
- Returns results as HashMap collections

4. Business rules:
- Must handle report execution safely
- Should manage report access control
- Needs to handle dynamic query execution

5. Dependencies:
- Uses Reporting bean class
- Handles dynamic result sets
- Manages report execution statements

Each interface represents a distinct aspect of the system's data access layer, with clear separation of concerns between customer management, UI text handling, and reporting functionality. The implementations would need to ensure thread safety, proper error handling, and secure data access patterns.
