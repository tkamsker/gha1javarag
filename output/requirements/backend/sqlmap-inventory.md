**File Type:** XML configuration

sqlmap-inventory.xml
1. Purpose: Manages database mappings for inventory-related data
2. User Interactions: No direct user interactions; used by backend services
3. Data Handling:
- Uses iBatis SQL mapping framework
- Implements caching with 3-hour flush interval
- Cache size limited to 1000 entries
4. Business Rules:
- Cache refreshes every 3 hours
- Read-only cache implementation
- Maximum cache size of 1000 items
5. Dependencies:
- Requires iBatis framework
- Integrated with ehcache caching system
- Likely depends on inventory-related DTO classes (not explicitly shown in preview)

Common Requirements Across Files:
- All files implement iBatis SQL mapping configuration
- All use ehcache provider for caching
- All follow similar configuration structure and patterns
- All are part of the cuco-core module
- All support backend database operations with caching optimization
