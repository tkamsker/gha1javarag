sqlmap-turnover.xml
1. Purpose: Manages turnover/revenue data persistence and caching
2. Data handling:
- Implements caching with ehcache provider
- Cache is not read-only (allows updates)
- Enables object serialization
3. Business rules:
- Supports both read and write operations
- Requires data persistence through serialization
- More dynamic data handling compared to location and shop configurations
4. Dependencies:
- iBatis framework
- at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.dto.Turnover DTO class
- Ehcache system
- Author attribution indicates organizational ownership

Common Patterns:
- All files use iBatis SQL mapping framework
- Consistent use of ehcache provider
- Varying cache configurations based on data volatility
- Part of a larger data access layer architecture
- Clear separation of concerns between different business entities
