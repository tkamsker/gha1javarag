- Read-only cache with no serialization
- Cache size limited to 1000 entries
3. Business Rules:
- Marketing interaction data is cached for longer periods (3 hours)

4. Dependencies:
- Relies on ehcache provider
- Part of the iBatis SQL mapping framework
- Likely interfaces with marketing-related services
