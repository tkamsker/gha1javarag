**File Type:** Java source file

POVDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Data access implementation for POV (Point of View/Product Offering Version) entities
- Manages POV history and product offering data
- Handles POV-related database operations

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions (data access layer)
- Supports POV management features

3. Data handling:
- Retrieves POV by ID
- Manages POV history records
- Handles product offering data
- Returns POV and POVHistory objects

4. Business rules:
- POV versioning logic
- History tracking requirements
- Product offering associations

5. Dependencies:
- AbstractDao base class
- POV and POVHistory DTOs
- ProductOffering integration
- Part of the CCT module's data access layer

All three implementations follow a similar pattern as part of the data access layer, extending AbstractDao and implementing their respective DAO interfaces. They handle different aspects of the business domain (Opportunities, Quotes, and POVs) while maintaining consistent data access patterns.
