sqlmap-location.xml
1. Purpose: Manages location data persistence and caching configuration using iBatis SQL mapping
2. Data handling:
- Implements caching with ehcache provider
- 3-hour cache refresh interval
- Cache size limited to 1000 entries
- Read-only cache configuration
- No serialization of cached objects
3. Business rules:
- Location data is relatively static (indicated by 3-hour cache duration)
- Prioritizes read performance over real-time updates
4. Dependencies:
- Requires iBatis framework
- Uses ehcache caching system
- Likely related to location/geographical entity management
