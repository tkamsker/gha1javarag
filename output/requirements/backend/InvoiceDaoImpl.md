1. Purpose and functionality:
- Data access implementation for invoice-related operations
- Extends AbstractDao and implements InvoiceDao interface
- Manages invoice data retrieval by party ID

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions as this is a DAO layer component

3. Data handling:
- Retrieves invoice records by party ID
- Handles Collections and Maps of invoice data
- Returns List<Invoice> objects

4. Business rules:
- Invoices must be associated with party IDs
- Appears to support multiple invoices per party

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on AbstractDao
- Requires InvoiceDao interface
- Uses Invoice DTO
- Utilizes Collection and Map interfaces for data handling

Common Patterns:
- All implementations extend AbstractDao
- Follow DAO pattern for data access
- Use DTOs for data transfer
- Implement specific interfaces for their domain
- Focus on single responsibility principle
- Part of a larger core module (cuco-core)
