sqlmap-invoice.xml
1. Purpose and functionality:
- iBatis SQL mapping configuration for invoice-related database operations
- Implements caching mechanism for invoice data using ehcache
- Handles invoice data persistence and retrieval

2. Data handling:
- Uses ehcache provider for caching invoice data
- Cache configuration:
  - 3-hour flush interval
  - Cache size of 1000 entries
  - Read-only cache with no serialization
- Likely contains SQL mappings for CRUD operations on invoice records

3. Business rules:
- Cache invalidation every 3 hours suggests moderate data freshness requirements
- Read-only cache indicates invoice data is primarily for retrieval/reporting

4. Dependencies:
- Requires iBatis framework
- Uses ehcache caching system
- Likely depends on invoice-related DTOs/entities
