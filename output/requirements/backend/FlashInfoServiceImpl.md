2. User Interactions:
- Manages flash information/notifications
- Backend service layer
3. Data Handling:
- Uses FlashInfoDao for database operations
- Handles lists and hash maps of data
- Appears to manage role-based information
4. Business Rules:
- Implements transactional operations (@Transactional)
- Likely includes role-based access control
- Manages flash information business logic
5. Dependencies:
- Spring Framework (@Service, @Autowired, @Transactional)
- FlashInfoDao for data access
