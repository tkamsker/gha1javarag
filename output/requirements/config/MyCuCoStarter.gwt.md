MyCuCoStarter.gwt.xml
1. Purpose and functionality:
- GWT module configuration for personal user interface ("My CuCo")
- Defines entry point for user-specific functionality
- Renames module output to "mycuco" for deployment

2. User interactions:
- Initializes personal user interface
- Provides entry point for user-specific features

3. Data handling:
- Configures source path for personal interface client-side code
- Inherits logging functionality for user operations

4. Business rules:
- Must inherit MyCuCo module for user-specific features
- Must implement logging for user activities

5. Dependencies and relationships:
- Depends on Google GWT Logging
- Depends on MyCuCo module
- Client source path dependency

Common patterns across all files:
- All use GWT 2.5.1 DTD
- All implement logging functionality
- All define specific client-side source paths
- All have distinct module rename configurations
- All serve as entry points for different aspects of the application (main app, admin, personal interface)
