CuCoMigrationE2E.xml
1. Purpose: Database migration configuration for End-to-End testing environment
2. User Interactions:
- Used by testing teams and DBAs
- Provides database update mechanisms for E2E environment
3. Data Handling:
- Configures E2E database migration paths
- Manages JDBC connections
- Controls script execution for schema updates
4. Business Rules:
- Uses E2E-specific properties (dbmaintain.e2e.properties)
- Defines migration execution order for test environment
5. Dependencies:
- Oracle JDBC driver (ojdbc6.jar)
- DBMaintain library
- E2E environment database

Common Patterns:
- All files are XML configurations serving different layers of the application
- Database migration files (DEV and E2E) share similar structure but target different environments
- Strict separation of concerns between service layer and database management
- Environment-specific configurations for different deployment scenarios
