# Requirements Analysis: src/java/Controller/AdminLogin.java

Certainly! Here is a detailed requirements analysis for the provided Java source file: `src/java/Controller/AdminLogin.java`.

---

## 1. Purpose and Functionality

**Purpose:**  
The `AdminLogin` servlet is designed to handle the login process for an administrator in a web application. It processes HTTP POST requests sent to the `/AdminLogin` endpoint, verifies the provided credentials against stored admin credentials in the database, and responds accordingly.

**Functionality:**
- Receives login credentials (username and password) from an HTTP POST request.
- Connects to the database to retrieve admin credentials.
- Compares the provided credentials with those stored in the database.
- If credentials match, notifies the user of successful login and redirects to the admin home page.
- If credentials do not match, notifies the user of failure and redirects to the login page.

## 2. User Interactions

**Actors:**
- **Administrator:** The primary user interacting with this servlet.

**Interaction Flow:**
1. The administrator accesses a login form (likely `index.jsp`) and submits their username and password.
2. The form sends a POST request to `/AdminLogin` with parameters:
   - `your_name` (username)
   - `your_pass` (password)
3. The servlet processes the request:
   - If credentials are correct, the admin sees a JavaScript alert ("Login Successfully..!") and is redirected to `AdminHome.jsp`.
   - If credentials are incorrect, the admin sees a JavaScript alert ("Username or Password is Incorrect..!") and is redirected back to `index.jsp`.

---

## 3. Data Handling

**Input Data:**
- `your_name`: The username entered by the admin.
- `your_pass`: The password entered by the admin.

**Processing:**
- The servlet retrieves these parameters from the request.
- It establishes a connection to the database using `DatabaseConnection.initializeDatabase()`.
- Executes the SQL query: `select *from adminreg` to fetch admin credentials.
- Iterates through the result set, assigning the last row's first and second columns to `user` and `pass` respectively.
- Compares the input credentials with the retrieved credentials.

**Output Data:**
- If successful, sends a JavaScript alert and redirects to `AdminHome.jsp`.
- If unsuccessful, sends a JavaScript alert and redirects to `index.jsp`.

**Note:**  
- The servlet does not use sessions or cookies to maintain login state.
- The servlet only compares credentials with the last row in the `adminreg` table (potentially a bug or limitation).

## 4. Business Rules

- **Authentication:** Only users whose credentials match the stored admin credentials are allowed access to the admin home page.
- **Feedback:** Users are immediately notified of the success or failure of their login attempt via a JavaScript alert.
- **Redirection:** Successful logins are redirected to the admin home page; failed logins are redirected back to the login page.
- **Credential Source:** Admin credentials are stored in the `adminreg` table in the database.
- **Security:** Credentials are compared in plain text; there is no password hashing or encryption.
- **Error Handling:** Exceptions are caught but not logged or reported (empty catch block).

---

## 5. Dependencies and Relationships

**Internal Dependencies:**
- **DatabaseConnection:** Used to establish a connection to the database.
- **adminreg Table:** Stores admin credentials (username and password).

**External Dependencies:**
- **Servlet API:** Uses `HttpServlet`, `HttpServletRequest`, `HttpServletResponse`, and annotations.
- **JSP Pages:** Redirects to `AdminHome.jsp` and `index.jsp` based on login outcome.

**Relationships:**
- **Front-End:** Expects a form (likely in `index.jsp`) to POST credentials to `/AdminLogin`.
- **Back-End:** Relies on the database schema (specifically, the `adminreg` table) for authentication.

---

## Additional Observations

- **Scalability:** Only supports one admin user (the last row in `adminreg`); does not support multiple admins.
- **Security:** Lacks password hashing, session management, and proper error handling/logging.
- **User Experience:** Uses JavaScript alerts for feedback, which may not be ideal for modern web applications.
- **Maintainability:** Hardcoded SQL and lack of prepared statements make it vulnerable to SQL injection (though not directly exploitable in this code, as no user input is used in the query).

| Aspect             | Details                                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Handle admin login authentication                                                      |
| User Interaction   | Admin submits credentials; receives alert and is redirected based on outcome           |
| Data Handling      | Receives credentials, fetches from DB, compares, responds with alert and redirect      |
| Business Rules     | Only correct credentials allow access; feedback via alert; redirects accordingly       |
| Dependencies       | DatabaseConnection, adminreg table, Servlet API, JSP pages                             |
| Security           | Lacks password hashing, session management, and robust error handling                  |
| Limitations        | Only supports one admin (last row in adminreg), no session tracking, poor error logging|

**In summary:**  
This file implements a basic admin login mechanism for a Java web application, handling credential verification and user feedback, but with significant limitations in scalability, security, and maintainability.
