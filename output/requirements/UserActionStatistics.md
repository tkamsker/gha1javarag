# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/report/UserActionStatistics.java

ActionStatisticBase.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Base class for action statistics reporting
- Provides common functionality for tracking and calculating statistics about system actions
- Serves as an abstract foundation for specialized statistics implementations

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions - serves as backend infrastructure

3. Data handling:
- Likely maintains counters and aggregates for action statistics
- Probably includes methods for data collection and calculation
- Should handle temporal data for reporting periods

4. Business rules:
- Defines core statistical calculation methods
- Establishes base metrics for action tracking
- Implements standard statistical formulas and aggregations

5. Dependencies:
- Parent class for UserActionStatistics and DepartmentActionStatistics
- Likely depends on core action logging/tracking system
- May integrate with reporting frameworks
