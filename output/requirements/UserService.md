src/main/java/com/bittercode/service/UserService.java

### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `UserService` interface defines methods for user authentication (`login`) and registration (`register`). These operations are crucial for managing user sessions and accounts within the application.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
Users interact by logging in with their credentials or registering new accounts. The service handles these interactions, validating inputs and managing session data.

### 3. Data Handling
The interface processes user login details (email, password) and registration information. It manages `HttpSession` to maintain user sessions post-login.

### 4. Business Rules
- Login must validate correct credentials and roles.
- Registration ensures unique email addresses to prevent duplicates.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
The service interacts with `User`, `UserRole`, and `StoreException` classes. It uses `HttpSession` for session management, indicating a dependency on servlet API components.
