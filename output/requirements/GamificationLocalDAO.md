# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/GamificationLocalDAO.java

GamificationLocalDAO.java
1. Purpose: Interface defining data access operations for gamification features
2. User Interactions: Handles agent-related gamification message processing
3. Data Handling:
   - Manages gamification messages
   - Marks messages as read
   - Stores messages in CuCoDB
4. Business Rules:
   - Messages can be marked as read for specific agents
   - Batch processing of messages supported
   - Agent-specific message handling
5. Dependencies:
   - Uses GamificationMessage DTO
   - Requires agent identification
   - Part of cuco-core module
   - Integrates with local database system

Key Methods:
- markAllMessagesRead(ArrayList<GamificationMessage>, String agentId)
- addAllMessagesToCuCoDB(ArrayList<GamificationMessage>, String agentId)

The interface suggests a gamification system implementation with message tracking and storage capabilities, likely part of a larger customer service or engagement platform.
