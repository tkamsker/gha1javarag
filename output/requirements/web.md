# Requirements Analysis: WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml

WebContent/WEB-INF/web.xml
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
- **Purpose**: This XML file is a deployment descriptor that defines how the web application behaves within a servlet container (e.g., Tomcat).
- **Functionality**:
  - Configures servlets, servlet mappings, filters, listeners, and other web application components.
  - Specifies initialization parameters for servlets and context parameters for the entire application.

### 2. User Interactions
- **No Direct User Interaction**: This file is used by the servlet container to configure the web application. It does not directly interact with end-users.

### 3. Data Handling
- **Servlet Configuration**: Defines servlets (e.g., SellerLoginServlet) and their mappings to URLs.
- **Context Parameters**: Specifies parameters that are available throughout the entire web application.
- **Filter Configuration**: Configures filters to intercept requests and responses for tasks like logging, authentication, or data transformation.

### 4. Business Rules
- **URL Patterns**: Defines how URLs are mapped to servlets (e.g., mapping /sellerLogin to SellerLoginServlet).
- **Session Management**: Specifies session timeout values and other session-related configurations.
- **Security Constraints**: May define security constraints such as authentication methods, role-based access control, and secure communication.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- **Servlet Container**: Relies on the servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) to interpret and apply the configuration defined in this file.
- **Servlet Classes**: References servlet classes (e.g., SellerLoginServlet) that are defined elsewhere in the project.
- **Web Application Components**: Defines how various web application components (e.g., servlets, filters, listeners) interact with each other.
