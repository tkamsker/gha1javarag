# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/com/bittercode/model/Book.java

src/main/java/com/bittercode/model/Book.java

### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `Book` class serves as a data model representing a book in an application. It encapsulates essential attributes such as barcode, name, author, price, and quantity. The constructor initializes these fields, ensuring that each book instance has all necessary details.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
Users interact with the `Book` class through CRUD operationsâ€”creating, reading, updating, or deleting books. This interaction is typically mediated by higher-level services or controllers in the application.

### 3. Data Handling
The class handles data through getters and setters for each field. It ensures that all book details are accurately stored and retrieved, maintaining data integrity.

### 4. Business Rules
- Barcode must be unique to prevent duplicate entries.
- Price must be a positive number.
- Quantity must be non-negative, reflecting available stock.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
The `Book` class has no external dependencies beyond standard Java types. It is used by other classes such as `Cart` to manage book items in user carts.
