# Requirements Analysis: src/main/java/com/bittercode/service/impl/UserServiceImpl.java

src/main/java/com/bittercode/service/impl/UserServiceImpl.java
### 1. Purpose and Functionality
The `UserServiceImpl` handles user-related operations, including authentication and session management using JDBC.

### 2. User Interactions (if applicable)
- No direct user interaction; used by higher layers like controllers for user sessions.

### 3. Data Handling
- Manages user data via SQL queries.
- Handles HTTP sessions for tracking user logins.

### 4. Business Rules
- Implements methods to validate users and manage sessions securely.
- Ensures proper exception handling for invalid operations or database errors.

### 5. Dependencies and Relationships
- Depends on `User` model, `StoreException`, and database constants (`UsersDBConstants`).
- Uses `HttpSession` for session management and JDBC for database interaction.
