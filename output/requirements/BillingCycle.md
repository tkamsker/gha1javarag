# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/BillingCycle.java

BillingCycle.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents billing cycle information
- Manages billing dates and associated entries
- Handles billing period data organization

2. Data handling:
- Stores billing date as Date object
- Maintains list of BillingCycleEntry objects
- Implements Serializable for data transfer

3. Business rules:
- Each billing cycle must have a date
- Can contain multiple billing cycle entries
- Must maintain serialization compatibility

4. Dependencies:
- Java Date utility
- BillingCycleEntry class
- Java Serializable interface
- Likely integrated with billing and payment processing systems
- May be used in financial reporting and invoice generation

These DTOs appear to be part of a larger customer management and billing system, with clear separation of concerns between customer interactions, product management, and billing processes.
