- Configuration resources must be accessible
- Configuration format must be valid
- Basic configuration structure must be intact

5. Dependencies:
- Spring Framework (ClassPathResource)
- JUnit
- Apache Commons IO
- Hamcrest matchers for assertions

Common Patterns Across Files:
- All files are test classes focusing on configuration validation
- Similar dependency structure (Spring, JUnit, Commons IO)
- Focus on resource loading and validation
- Use of assertion frameworks for verification
- Part of a larger product offering configuration system
