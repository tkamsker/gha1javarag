### Service Sizing and Scope
**Small Services (1-2 developers)**:
- Customer Profile Service
- Product Pricing Service
- Support Knowledge Base Service

**Medium Services (3-5 developers)**:
- Order Processing Service
- Billing Service
- Security Service

**Large Services (6+ developers)**:
- Customer Management Service
- Network Management Service
- Support Ticketing Service

### Data Ownership Principles
- Each service owns its data domain exclusively
- Data is immutable from external service perspective
- Cross-service data access through well-defined APIs only
- Database schema changes are managed within service boundaries
- Data migration strategies for legacy system integration

## 2. Microservice Design Patterns

### API-first Design Principles
- RESTful APIs with clear resource-based URLs
- JSON Schema validation for all request/response payloads
- Comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Versioned APIs with backward compatibility guarantees
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms
- API gateway for unified access management

### Event-driven Architecture
- **Event Publishing**: Services publish domain events (customer created, order placed, payment processed)
- **Event Consumption**: Services subscribe to relevant events for state synchronization
- **Event Store**: Centralized event store for audit trails and replay capabilities
- **Message Brokers**: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ for reliable message queuing
- **Event Sourcing**: Critical business operations are captured as immutable events

### Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions
**Order Processing Saga**:
1. Create order in Order Service
2. Reserve inventory in Product Catalog Service
3. Process payment in Billing Service
4. Send confirmation in Customer Service
5. Update network provisioning in Network Service

**Compensation Logic**: 
- Each step has rollback capability
- Saga orchestrator manages transaction flow
- Idempotent operations for fault tolerance
- Eventual consistency through compensating actions

### Circuit Breaker and Retry Mechanisms
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascading failures with timeout thresholds
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff retry strategies for transient failures
- **Bulkhead Isolation**: Resource isolation to prevent service degradation
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for external service calls
- **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation with cached responses or default values

## 3. Service Communication Requirements

### Synchronous Communication (REST, GraphQL)
**REST APIs**:
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

- **Service Mesh Integration**: Istio for advanced service discovery and management

### API Versioning Strategies
- **URL Versioning**: `/api/v1/customers`, `/api/v2/products`
- **Header Versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.a1.cuco.v1+json`
- **Query Parameter Versioning**: `?version=2.0`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Major version changes for breaking changes only
- **Deprecation Policies**: 6-month deprecation timeline with migration guides
