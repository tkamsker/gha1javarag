  "**Requirement: User and Admin Management via HTTP POST**\n\nThe system shall provide HTTP POST endpoints for user and admin management, including the ability to register and log in users and administrators, as well as to add doctors, patients, receptionists, and workers, and update patient records. Each endpoint shall be implemented as a controller class with a doPost method to handle the respective POST requests.\n\n**Covered functionalities:**\n- User Registration (UserRegister)\n- User Login (UserLogin)\n- Admin Registration (AdminRegister)\n- Admin Login (AdminLogin)\n- Add Doctor (AddDoctor)\n- Add Patient (AddPatient)\n- Add Receptionist (AddRecp)\n- Add Worker (AddWorker)\n- Update Patient Information (updatePatient)",
  "**Requirement:**\n\nThe system shall implement a server-side HTTP POST request handler by providing a method with the following signature:  \n`void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)`.  \nThis method must process incoming HTTP POST requests and appropriately handle the associated HTTP servlet request and response objects.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThis is based on the recurrent implementation of the `doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)` method with a `void` return type, typically used in Java servlets to support POST operations."
