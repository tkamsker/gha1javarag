# Non-Functional Requirements

## Overview
This section describes the non-functional requirements of the system, including performance, security, scalability, maintainability, and usability requirements.


### PERFORMANCE Requirements

#### NFR-Performance-001

**Description:** The system shall provide a response time of less than 2 seconds for 95% of user interactions under normal operating conditions.

**Rationale:** Fast response times enhance user experience and meet user expectations.

**Verification Method:** Performance testing with simulated user loads.


### SECURITY Requirements

#### NFR-Security-001

**Description:** The system shall enforce user authentication using multi-factor authentication for all administrative users.

**Rationale:** To prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of data breaches.

**Verification Method:** Security audit and penetration testing.


### SCALABILITY Requirements

#### NFR-Scalability-001

**Description:** The system shall be able to scale horizontally to support a 200% increase in concurrent users without degradation in performance.

**Rationale:** To ensure continued performance as user demand grows over time.

**Verification Method:** Load testing by incrementally increasing the number of concurrent users.


### MAINTAINABILITY Requirements

#### NFR-Maintainability-001

**Description:** The system codebase shall have a modular structure with a maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10 per function.

**Rationale:** Lower complexity and modularity facilitate easier maintenance and future development.

**Verification Method:** Automated code analysis and code reviews.


### USABILITY Requirements

#### NFR-Usability-001

**Description:** The system shall allow new users to complete their first primary task within 5 minutes without prior training.

**Rationale:** Intuitive usability improves user satisfaction and reduces learning time.

**Verification Method:** Usability testing with representative new users.
