# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/test/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/validator/AONNumberValidatorTest.java

AONNumberValidatorTest.java
1. Purpose: Test class for validating AON (likely Account or Order Number) validation logic
2. User interactions: N/A - Unit test file
3. Data handling: Tests validation of AON number strings
4. Business rules:
   - Validates AON number format
   - Likely checks for specific number patterns or formats
   - May include business-specific validation rules for AON numbers
5. Dependencies:
   - JUnit testing framework
   - Mockito for mocking
   - AONNumberValidator class being tested

Common patterns across all files:
- All are unit test classes using JUnit and Mockito frameworks
- Follow similar structure with @Before setup and @Test methods
- Part of validation framework for input validation
- Located in the cuco-core module under shared.validator package
- Focus on specific data type validation requirements
