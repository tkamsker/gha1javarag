# Requirements Analysis: administration.ui/src/main/java/at/a1ta/webclient/cucosett/client/service/ChargingTypeServlet.java

ChargingTypeServlet.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Remote service interface for managing charging types
- Provides access to charging type data through RPC calls
- Path mapped to "cuco/chargingType.rpc"

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions as this is a service interface
- Called by client-side code to retrieve charging type information

3. Data handling:
- Returns List<ChargingType> containing charging type records
- Works with ChargingType DTO objects

4. Business rules:
- Read-only access to charging type data based on interface definition
- Must implement RemoteService for GWT RPC functionality

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on GWT RemoteService
- Uses ChargingType DTO from core module
- Client applications depend on this service for charging type data
