# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/chart/ChartDataSet.java

ChartDataSet.java

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents individual data sets within a chart
- Stores ordered key-value pairs of chart data
- Provides identification and data access methods

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions; supports chart data organization

3. Data handling:
- Implements Serializable for data transfer
- Uses LinkedHashMap to maintain data order
- Generic implementation for flexible data types
- Includes unique identifier for the data set

4. Business rules:
- Each dataset must have a unique identifier
- Maintains insertion order of data points

5. Dependencies:
- Used by ChartData class
- Uses Java Collections framework
- Part of larger charting/visualization system

These three classes form part of a data transfer and visualization system, with ChartData and ChartDataSet providing structured data for charts, while MobilPoints handles specific business logic for mobile points tracking.
