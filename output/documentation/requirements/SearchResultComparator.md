# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/SearchResultComparator.java

SearchResultComparator.java
1. Purpose: Provides comparison logic for Party objects in search results
2. User Interactions: None - utility class
3. Data Handling:
   - Implements Comparator<Party> and Serializable
   - Compares Party objects using custom comparison string logic
4. Business Rules:
   - Custom comparison logic for Party objects
   - Creates standardized comparison strings
5. Dependencies:
   - Party class
   - Comparator interface
   - Serializable interface
   - Uses custom buildComparisonString method for comparison logic

Common Themes:
- All classes implement Serializable for data transfer
- Part of a larger customer management system
- Focus on data transfer and manipulation rather than direct user interaction
- Clear separation of concerns between data storage, comparison, and configuration
