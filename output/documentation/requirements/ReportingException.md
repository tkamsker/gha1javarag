ReportingException.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Custom exception class for reporting-related errors
- Provides error handling for reporting operations
- Implements Serializable for RPC transport

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Used to communicate errors to client applications

3. Data handling:
- Carries error messages
- Serializable for network transport
- Supports both empty and message-based constructors

4. Business rules:
- Must be serializable for GWT RPC
- Runtime exception handling for reporting operations

5. Dependencies:
- Extends RuntimeException
- Implements Serializable
- Used by ReportingServlet and related components

The system appears to be a GWT-based web application with reporting and charging type management capabilities, using RPC for client-server communication.
