- Serves as a foundation for security-related features

2. Data handling:
- Implements Serializable for object persistence
- Uses XML binding annotations
- Handles boolean flags and BigDecimal values
- Manages internal security configurations

3. Business rules:
- Must implement proper serialization handling
- Security settings must follow specific validation rules
- Requires precise numerical handling for security-related calculations

4. Dependencies:
- Implements Serializable
- Uses javax.xml.bind annotations
- Requires java.math.BigDecimal for calculations

Common Patterns Across Files:
- All use XML binding annotations for data handling
- Follow a base class pattern for extensibility
- Implement Serializable for persistence
- Part of the digital selling module within the cuco-core system
- Follow similar naming and structural conventions
