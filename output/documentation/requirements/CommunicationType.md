# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/salesinfo/visitreport/sbs/CommunicationType.java

CommunicationType.java
1. Purpose: Defines an enumeration of possible communication methods for interactions
2. User interactions:
   - Used in form selections
   - Communication method tracking
3. Data handling: Simple enum with three values:
   - WRITTEN
   - PERSONAL
   - TELEPHONIC
4. Business rules:
   - Restricts communication types to three valid options
   - Used for categorizing interaction methods
5. Dependencies:
   - Part of the salesinfo.visitreport.sbs package
   - Used in visit report related functionality
   - Likely referenced by classes tracking communication methods

Common Themes:
- All files are part of a sales/visit reporting system
- They appear to be DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) used for data exchange
- Part of a larger SBS (Sales Business System) module
- Focus on standardizing data representation for business processes
