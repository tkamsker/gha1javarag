# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/salesinfo/visitreport/digitalselling/MobileTariffBase.java

MobileTariffBase.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Base class for mobile tariff data structures
- Handles core mobile tariff information serialization
- Implements Serializable for data transfer/persistence

2. Data handling:
- XML-based serialization (indicated by @XmlAccessorType)
- Manages minimum tariff information
- Likely includes fields for basic tariff properties

3. Business rules:
- Must maintain serialization compatibility (serialVersionUID)
- Follows XML field access patterns
- Serves as foundation for mobile tariff implementations

4. Dependencies:
- Java Serializable interface
- JAXB annotations for XML handling
- Likely extended by other tariff-specific classes
