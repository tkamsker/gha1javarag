LocationDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Data access implementation for location-related operations
- Extends AbstractDao and implements LocationDao interface
- Manages location data retrieval and mapping

- Uses Location DTOs from clarify.shared package
- Likely implements location lookup/mapping functionality

4. Business rules:
- Location data appears to be keyed by Long identifiers
- Uses suppressed warnings for unchecked operations

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on AbstractDao
- Implements LocationDao interface
- Uses Location DTO from bite.data.clarify package
