# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/test/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/solr/AbstractSolrRepositoryTest.java

AbstractSolrRepositoryTest.java
1. Purpose:
- Abstract base class for Solr repository tests
- Provides common test infrastructure
- Sets up shared mocking behavior

2. User Interactions:
- No direct user interactions (test infrastructure)

3. Data Handling:
- Establishes base template for Solr operations
- Provides common mock objects
- Sets up basic repository testing structure

4. Business Rules:
- Defines standard testing patterns
- Ensures consistent test setup across repository tests

5. Dependencies:
- Uses MockitoJUnitRunner
- Depends on SolrTemplate
- Extends SimpleSolrRepository
- Core testing infrastructure for other repository tests

The three files form a hierarchical testing structure where AbstractSolrRepositoryTest provides the base testing infrastructure, SolrPartyRepositoryTest implements general party-related tests, and SolrPartyRepositoryWithPhoneNumbersTest adds specific phone number-related test cases. Together they ensure proper functionality of the Solr-based party repository system.
