VisitReportDao.java
1. Purpose and functionality:

- Specifies contract for visit report management
- Defines methods for handling sales info and history notes

2. Data handling:
- Defines methods for managing visit report collections
- Specifies operations for sales info notes
- Handles ToDo group note operations
- Manages history note data

3. Business rules:
- Defines required operations for visit report management
- Specifies data access patterns
- Establishes contract for note type handling
- Sets requirements for history tracking

4. Dependencies:
- Uses DTO classes (SalesInfoNote, HistoryNote, etc.)
- Defines relationship with ToDoGroupNote handling
- Relies on collection frameworks
