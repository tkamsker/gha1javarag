# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/model/seg/MultiPartyMatrixData.java

MultiPartyMatrixData.java
1. Purpose: Manages matrix-based data structure for multiple party product groups
2. User Interactions: None directly - serves as a data structure
3. Data Handling:
   - Uses nested HashMap structure for matrix representation
   - Stores MultiPartyProductGroup objects in ArrayList
   - Matrix positions identified by Long keys
4. Business Rules:
   - Matrix structure allows multiple product groups per position
   - Uses two-dimensional mapping (matrix-style access)
5. Dependencies:
   - MatrixPosition DTO
   - MultiPartyProductGroup class
   - Java Collections (HashMap, ArrayList)

Key Observations:
- All classes are part of a core shared model package
- System appears to handle product management with multi-party relationships
- Strong focus on data structuring and organization
- Uses DTOs for data transfer between system components
- Implements serialization for data persistence/transfer
