# Requirements Analysis: cuco/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/admin/starter/client/AdminStarter.java

AdminStarter.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Entry point for admin interface
- Initializes administrative components
- Manages admin application startup

2. User interactions:
- Sets up admin interface
- Handles administrative user interactions

3. Data handling:
- Manages admin-specific settings
- Handles LocalSettingPool for admin interface
- Processes TextPool for admin UI

4. Business rules:
- Must extend BiteEntryPoint
- Requires admin privileges
- Should initialize admin-specific components

5. Dependencies:
- BiteEntryPoint
- ExtJS/GXT UI components
- DTO classes (LocalSettingPool, SettingPool, TextPool)

The system appears to be a web application with separate user and admin interfaces, using GWT for the frontend and implementing proper cache control mechanisms. The architecture follows a clear separation between admin and regular user functionality.
