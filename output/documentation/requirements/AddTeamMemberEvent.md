# Requirements Analysis: administration.ui/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/admin/ui/common/client/event/AddTeamMemberEvent.java

AddTeamMemberEvent.java
1. Purpose: Manages events for adding team members to the system
2. User Interactions: Triggered when adding new team members
3. Data Handling:
   - Manages List<ModelData<BiteUser>> for team member data
   - Handles BiteUser objects within ModelData wrapper
4. Business Rules:
   - Supports multiple team member additions
   - Must maintain team member data integrity
5. Dependencies:
   - Depends on bite.core.shared.dto.BiteUser
   - Uses ui.common.client.ui.ModelData
   - Extends framework.ui.client.event.PortletEvent

Common Patterns:
- All files extend PortletEvent for event handling
- Focus on administrative functions
- Support for data model manipulation
- Clear separation of concerns between UI and data handling
