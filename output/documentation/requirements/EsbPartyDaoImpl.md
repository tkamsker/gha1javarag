# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/esb/EsbPartyDaoImpl.java

EsbPartyDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Implementation class for ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) party data access
- Handles party-related data operations through ESB

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Used by service layer for party data operations

3. Data handling:
- Likely handles EsbParty objects
- Uses Spring framework for dependency injection
- Implements ESB client operations

4. Business rules:
- Must handle ESB exceptions appropriately
- Follows ESB communication protocols
- Requires proper configuration through SettingService

5. Dependencies:
- Spring Framework (@Repository, @Autowired)
- BaseEsbClient
- SettingService
- EsbParty DTO
- ServiceClas[...] (incomplete in preview)
- Handles EsbException

The files appear to be part of a larger customer management system with ESB integration, handling mobile points, POS locations, and party information. The architecture follows DAO pattern with clear separation of interface and implementation.
