# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/test/resources/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/esb/GetTariffOfferSimulationNoSimulationData.xml

GetTariffOfferSimulationNoSimulationData.xml

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents a response structure for tariff offer simulation when no simulation data is available
- Provides basic current tariff information and additional status information
- Used for error or edge case handling in tariff simulation requests

2. User interactions:
- Response to user requests for tariff simulations
- Displays current tariff details when simulation cannot be performed

3. Data handling:
- Contains current tariff code and name (A1S12_7, "A1 Xcite")
- Empty CurrentServices section
- Additional information with code "M" and explanatory text
- No simulation data included

4. Business rules:
- Returns basic tariff information even when simulation is not possible
- Includes reason codes for simulation unavailability
- Maintains minimum response structure despite lack of simulation data

5. Dependencies:
- Part of TariffGuide namespace
- Requires integration with tariff management system
- Used by simulation processing components
