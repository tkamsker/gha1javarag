# Requirements Analysis: administration.ui/src/main/java/at/a1ta/webclient/cucosett/client/service/TeamServlet.java

TeamServlet.java
1. Purpose: Synchronous service interface for team management operations
2. User Interactions:
   - Defines remote service endpoints for team operations
   - Provides team management functionality
3. Data Handling:
   - Processes Team, BiteUser, and Service DTOs
   - Uses RemoteService pattern
   - Handles ArrayList collections
4. Business Rules:
   - Defines base contract for team management operations
   - Annotated with @RemoteServiceRelativePath for GWT RPC
5. Dependencies:
   - GWT RemoteService
   - Team, BiteUser, Service DTOs
   - RpcStatus DTO
   - Paired with TeamServletAsync for asynchronous operations

Common Patterns:
- All files are part of a GWT-based web application
- Follow client-server architecture with RPC communication
- Use DTO pattern for data transfer
- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces
- Handle operation status through RpcStatus
