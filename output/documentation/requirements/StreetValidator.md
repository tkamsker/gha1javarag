# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/validator/StreetValidator.java

StreetValidator.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Validates street address entries
- Ensures minimum length requirements for street names
- Handles blank value scenarios

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Used by other components for address validation

3. Data handling:
- Takes string input value
- Returns boolean validation result
- Handles null/blank values

4. Business rules:
- Street names must be at least 3 characters long
- Blank values are considered valid
- Non-blank values must meet length requirement

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on CommonValidator for blank checking and string length validation
- Part of address validation framework

General Notes:
- All validators are part of the same package (at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.validator)
- They follow a consistent pattern of boolean validation methods
- The implementation suggests a modular approach to input validation
- There appears to be a common dependency on CommonValidator for basic validation operations
