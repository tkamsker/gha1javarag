# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/resources/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/sqlmap-chargingtype.xml

sqlmap-chargingtype.xml

1. Purpose and functionality:
- Defines SQL mapping configuration for charging type data management
- Handles charging type definitions in the CUCO system
- Implements caching using ehcache provider

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions; serves as data access layer configuration

3. Data handling:
- Maps ChargingType DTO objects to database structures
- Implements read-only caching for charging type data
- Uses iBatis SQL mapping framework

4. Business rules:
- Charging types are cached and treated as read-only reference data
- Cache configuration suggests infrequently changing data

5. Dependencies:
- Requires at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.dto.ChargingType class
- Depends on ehcache provider for caching
- Part of the CUCO core data access layer
