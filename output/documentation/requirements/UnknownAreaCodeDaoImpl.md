# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/impl/UnknownAreaCodeDaoImpl.java

UnknownAreaCodeDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose: Data access implementation for handling unknown area codes
2. User Interactions:
   - Supports deletion of unknown area codes
   - Likely part of area code management system
3. Data Handling:
   - Extends AbstractDao for database operations
   - Implements UnknownAreaCodeDao interface
   - Performs delete operations on unknown area codes
4. Business Rules:
   - Manages unrecognized or invalid area codes
   - Supports cleanup of invalid area code entries
5. Dependencies:
   - Depends on AbstractDao for base database operations
   - Uses UnknownAreaCode DTO for data transfer
   - Connected to "UnknownAreaCode" database operations

Common Patterns:
- All implementations extend AbstractDao
- Follow DAO pattern for data access
- Use corresponding DTO objects for data transfer
- Implement specific interfaces for their functionality
- Part of the at.a1ta.cuco.core system
