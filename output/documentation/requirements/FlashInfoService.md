# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/FlashInfoService.java

FlashInfoService.java

Unable to provide complete analysis as only copyright header is visible. Based on the name, it likely:
1. Purpose: Manages flash information/notifications
2. Would handle temporary information display
3. Would manage flash message data
But would need to see actual interface/implementation to provide detailed requirements.

Note: For CustomerBlockService.java and FlashInfoService.java, only copyright headers are visible in the preview. A complete analysis would require access to the full source code of these files.
