- Manages invoice identification and validation
- Handles invoice dates and comparisons

4. Business rules:
- BOB invoice IDs must:
  - Start with prefix "5000"
  - Meet minimum length requirement (12 characters)
- Implements custom date-based comparison logic

5. Dependencies:
- Java.io.Serializable
- Java.util.Comparator
- Java.util.Date
