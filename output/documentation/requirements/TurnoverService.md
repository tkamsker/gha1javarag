# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/TurnoverService.java

TurnoverService.java
1. Purpose: Service layer component for handling business turnover calculations and operations
2. User Interactions: Not directly visible in preview, likely internal service operations
3. Data Handling: Presumably processes financial/turnover data
4. Business Rules: Likely contains turnover calculation logic and business validation rules
5. Dependencies: Part of the cuco-core module, likely depends on data access layer components

Note: Limited visibility of actual implementation makes detailed analysis difficult.
