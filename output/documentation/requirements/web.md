# Requirements Analysis: cuco/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml

web.xml
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Java web application configuration file
- Defines servlet container settings
- Configures application context and dependencies

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Controls application behavior and routing

3. Data handling:
- Defines application context configuration locations
- XML-based configuration management
- Uses Java EE 3.0 specifications

4. Business rules:
- Must follow Java EE 3.0 standards
- Application context must be properly configured
- Configuration paths must be valid

5. Dependencies:
- Java EE 3.0 environment
- Referenced application context files
- XML Schema definitions
- Spring framework (implied by applicationContext references)
- Must align with servlet container version

The files suggest a Java web application with separate public and authenticated user interfaces, following modern web standards and Spring framework architecture.
