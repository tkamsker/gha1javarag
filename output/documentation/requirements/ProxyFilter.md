# Requirements Analysis: administration.ui/src/main/java/at/a1ta/framework/gxt/ui/ProxyFilter.java

ProxyFilter.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Generic interface for implementing proxy filters
- Provides mechanism to bind filters to data loaders
- Enables filter validation and data reloading

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions
- Used as backend component for filtering functionality

3. Data handling:
- Works with generic type parameter M (ModelData)
- Interfaces with BaseListLoader for data loading operations

4. Business rules:
- Filter can only be bound to one loader at a time
- Must implement validation logic for filter criteria

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on GXT UI library
- Uses BaseListLoader and ModelData from GXT framework
