# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/product/Coordinates.java

Coordinates.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents geographical coordinates
- Stores longitude and latitude values
- Implements Serializable for data transfer

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions, serves as a data container

3. Data handling:
- Stores longitude and latitude as double values
- Provides getter/setter methods
- Implements serialization

4. Business rules:
- Must maintain valid coordinate values
- Supports coordinate system requirements

5. Dependencies and relationships:
- Implements Serializable interface
- No other direct dependencies

These files appear to be part of a larger system dealing with contract/product management and potentially location-based services. The DTOs suggest a service-oriented architecture with data transfer requirements between system components.
