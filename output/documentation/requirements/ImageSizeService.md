# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/ImageSizeService.java

ImageSizeService.java
1. Purpose: Service for handling image size operations/validations
2. User interactions: Not directly visible in preview, likely internal service
3. Data handling: Presumably works with image metadata and dimensions
4. Business rules: Likely contains validation rules for acceptable image sizes
5. Dependencies: Part of cuco-core module

Note: Limited visibility of actual implementation makes detailed analysis difficult.
