# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/CrmAuthenticationPasswordInfo.java

CrmAuthenticationPasswordInfo.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Handles password-related information for CRM authentication
- DTO for password data transfer
- Implements Serializable with explicit serialVersionUID

2. Data handling:
- Stores two attributes:
  - value: Password value (String)
  - type: Password type identifier (String)
- Provides getter/setter methods
- Includes empty constructor

3. Business rules:
- Part of CRM authentication system
- Separates password value from type for flexible authentication handling

4. Dependencies:
- java.io.Serializable
- Integrated with CRM authentication system
- Security-sensitive component requiring careful handling

Note: All these classes appear to be part of a larger system's data transfer layer, with each serving specific roles in image management, product categorization, and authentication respectively.
