# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/FlashInfoDao.java

FlashInfoDao.java
1. Purpose: Data access interface for flash information/notifications
2. User Interactions: Likely indirect through service layer
3. Data Handling: Presumably manages flash messages or notifications data
4. Business Rules: Not enough content visible to determine specific rules
5. Dependencies: Part of core DAO layer, likely depends on database infrastructure

Common Characteristics:
- All files are part of the at.a1ta.cuco.core.dao.db package
- Follow DAO pattern for data access abstraction
- Copyright by A1 Telekom Austria AG
- Part of a larger enterprise system with clear separation of concerns

Note: Due to limited content visibility in some files, certain aspects of the analysis are based on naming conventions and standard DAO patterns.
