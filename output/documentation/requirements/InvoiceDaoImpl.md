# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/impl/InvoiceDaoImpl.java

InvoiceDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Data access implementation for invoice-related operations
- Extends AbstractDao and implements InvoiceDao interface
- Manages invoice data retrieval by party ID

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions (DAO layer)

3. Data handling:
- Retrieves invoice records by party ID
- Uses Invoice DTOs
- Handles Collections and Maps for data organization

4. Business rules:
- Invoices are associated with party IDs
- Likely implements filtering and lookup operations

5. Dependencies:
- Depends on AbstractDao
- Implements InvoiceDao interface
- Uses Invoice DTO for data transfer
- Utilizes Collection and Map interfaces for data handling

Common Patterns:
- All implementations extend AbstractDao
- Follow DAO pattern for data access abstraction
- Use DTOs for data transfer
- Implement specific interfaces for their domains
- Part of the cuco-core module
- Focus on single-responsibility principle
