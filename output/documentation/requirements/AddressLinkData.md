AddressLinkData.java
1. Purpose: Represents a data structure for storing address information
2. User Interactions: None directly - serves as a data model
3. Data Handling:

   - Implements Serializable for data transfer/persistence
   - Standard getter/setter methods for all fields
4. Business Rules:
   - Address components are stored separately (street, house number, etc.)
   - All fields are optional (no validation rules visible)
5. Dependencies:
   - Java Serializable interface
   - Used by ProductDetail class
