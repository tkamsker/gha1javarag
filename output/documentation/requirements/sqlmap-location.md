# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/resources/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/sqlmap-location.xml

sqlmap-location.xml
1. Purpose: Manages location data persistence and caching configuration using iBatis SQL mapping
2. Data Handling:
- Implements caching with ehcache provider
- 3-hour cache flush interval
- Cache size limited to 1000 entries
- Read-only cache configuration
- No serialization of cached objects
3. Business Rules:
- Location data is treated as relatively static (3hr cache)
- Optimized for read operations
4. Dependencies:
- Requires iBatis framework
- Uses ehcache caching system
- Part of the cuco-core data access layer
