# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/salesinfo/visitreport/digitalselling/PaymentOld.java

PaymentOld.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Handles legacy payment information
- Manages various payment-related data
- Provides serializable payment record structure

2. User interactions:
- Stores payment method selections
- Captures payment-related user choices

3. Data handling:
- Implements Serializable for persistence
- Stores payment app information
- Manages payment amounts using BigDecimal

4. Business rules:
- Must maintain payment record integrity
- Supports legacy payment processing rules
- Ensures payment data persistence

5. Dependencies:
- Java Serializable interface
- JAXB annotations for XML handling
- BigDecimal for monetary calculations
- Likely integrates with payment processing systems

Note: These appear to be part of a larger digital selling system, specifically handling visit reports and sales information. The "Old" suffix suggests these are legacy classes that might be maintained for backward compatibility while newer versions exist elsewhere in the system.
