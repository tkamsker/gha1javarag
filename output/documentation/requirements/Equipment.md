# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/customerequipment/Equipment.java

Equipment.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents customer equipment in a hierarchical structure
- Manages equipment relationships (parent-child)
- Supports equipment comparison and organization

2. Data handling:
- Stores equipment attributes: id, name, parent info
- Implements Comparable for sorting/ordering
- Manages hierarchical relationships
- Handles dates and equipment-specific data

3. Business rules:
- Supports hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
- Top-level equipment has empty parent ID
- Equipment items can be compared and sorted
- Maintains consistent parent-child relationships

4. Dependencies:
- Implements Serializable and Comparable interfaces
- Uses ArrayList for collections
- Part of customerequipment DTO package
- Manages self-referential relationships through parent property

All three files are part of a larger DTO (Data Transfer Object) structure, suggesting a service-oriented architecture with clear separation between data transfer and business logic layers.
