# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/usagedata/InetUsage.java

InetUsage.java
1. Purpose: Represents internet usage data and associated costs for a service period
2. User Interactions: Used to display and track internet usage metrics
3. Data Handling:
   - Implements Serializable for data persistence
   - Stores multiple usage metrics:
     - Usage date
     - Duration
     - Upload/download volumes
     - Various fee types
     - Volume overrun
4. Business Rules:
   - Tracks three types of fees:
     - Subscription (base) fee
     - Variable usage fee
     - High usage penalty fee
   - Monitors transfer volume overages
5. Dependencies:
   - Requires Java Date utility
   - Part of the usagedata DTO package
   - Likely used with billing and usage monitoring systems

These files appear to be part of a larger telecommunications service management system, handling product categorization, provider information, and usage tracking. The system seems focused on both fixed-line and mobile services with sophisticated usage monitoring and billing capabilities.
