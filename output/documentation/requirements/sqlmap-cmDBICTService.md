# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/resources/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/cmdb/sqlmap-cmDBICTService.xml

sqlmap-cmDBICTService.xml
1. Purpose: SQL mapping definitions for ICT Service operations in CMDB
2. User Interactions: N/A - Database mapping configuration
3. Data Handling:
- Defines cache model for ICT service data
- Contains SQL queries and result mappings
- Implements read-only caching strategy
4. Business Rules:
- 1-hour cache flush interval
- Cache size limited to 1
- Read-only cache implementation
- No serialization for cached objects
5. Dependencies:
- iBatis framework
- EhCache implementation
- Depends on sqlmap-config-cmdb.xml
- Related database tables for ICT services

Common Themes:
- Part of a larger CMDB system
- Heavy focus on caching and performance optimization
- Uses Spring + iBatis stack
- Emphasis on configuration over code
- Structured data access patterns
