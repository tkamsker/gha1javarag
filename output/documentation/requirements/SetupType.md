3. Data handling:
- Simple enum with three values:
  - NEW: Complete new setup
  - NEW_SERVICE: New service setup
  - NEW_LINE: New line setup

4. Business rules:

These files appear to be part of a larger customer/sales management system, specifically handling visit reports and setup information. The system seems to support digital selling features and follows standard Java enterprise patterns for data transfer objects.
