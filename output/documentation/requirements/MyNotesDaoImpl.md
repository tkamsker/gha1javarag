# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/impl/MyNotesDaoImpl.java

MyNotesDaoImpl.java
1. Purpose: Data access implementation for managing user notes
2. User Interactions: Indirect - handles storage and retrieval of user notes
3. Data Handling:
- Extends AbstractDao
- Uses SearchResult for query results
- Implements MyNotesDao interface
- Uses Maps for data storage
4. Business Rules:
- Manages note-related operations
- Likely implements search and filtering functionality
5. Dependencies:
- Spring framework (@Autowired)
- SettingService integration
- AbstractDao base class
- SearchResult functionality
- Part of the core note management system

Common Patterns:
- All implementations extend AbstractDao
- Follow DAO pattern for data access
- Part of the core module (cuco-core)
- Use Spring framework
- Implement corresponding DAO interfaces
