- Multiple constructors for different initialization scenarios
- Default state is UNKNOWN

4. Business rules:
- Three valid states: VIP, NO_VIP, UNKNOWN
- Default state must be UNKNOWN
- Supports both enum and integer representation of status

5. Dependencies:
- Implements Serializable interface
- Self-contained enum definition
