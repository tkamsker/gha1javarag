# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/service/LinksPortletService.java

LinksPortletService.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Serves as an interface for managing links in a portlet system
- Provides functionality to retrieve links data
- Appears to be part of a larger portal or web application system

2. User interactions:
- Indirect - users likely interact with this service through a UI layer that displays the links

3. Data handling:
- Returns List<LinksPortlet> containing link information
- Uses LinksPortlet DTO (Data Transfer Object) to structure link data
- Implements read-only functionality (no visible create/update/delete operations)

4. Business rules:
- getAllLinks() suggests no filtering or restrictions on link retrieval
- Appears to be a simple data access interface

5. Dependencies and relationships:
- Depends on LinksPortlet DTO class from at.a1ta.cuco.core.shared.dto package
- Likely used by a presentation layer component or controller
- Part of the at.a1ta.cuco.core.service package structure

For a more complete analysis of UnknownAreaCodeService.java and FreeUnitService.java, access to their actual interface or implementation code would be needed.
