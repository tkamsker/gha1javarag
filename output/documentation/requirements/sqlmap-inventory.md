- Configures cache size limit of 1000 entries
- Uses ehcache provider with non-serialized storage

4. Business rules:
- Cache refreshes every 3 hours indicating semi-dynamic data
- Limited to 1000 cached entries suggesting memory optimization
- Read-only cache implementation

5. Dependencies:
- Uses ehcache provider
- Part of CUCO core inventory management system
- Integrated with iBatis SQL mapping framework

Common themes across all files:
- All use iBatis SQL mapping framework
- Implement caching strategies for performance
