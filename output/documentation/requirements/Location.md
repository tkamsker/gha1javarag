# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/product/Location.java

Location.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents physical or virtual locations
- Manages address and coordinate information
- Supports different location types (MOBILE, FIXED, HYBRID)

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions; data container

3. Data handling:
- Stores location details:
  - partyId: unique identifier
  - locationId: location reference
  - address components (city, street, poBox)
  - coordinates
- Implements Serializable
- Uses enum for location type classification

4. Business rules:
- Supports three distinct location types
- Requires party ID association
- Maintains structured address format

5. Dependencies:
- Coordinates class
- LocationType enum (internal)
- Java Serializable interface

These classes appear to be part of a larger telecommunications or service location management system, with GeoCallNumber and Location serving as data containers and ProductTree providing organizational structure.
