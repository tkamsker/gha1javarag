# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/dao/db/ReportingDao.java

ReportingDao.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Interface for handling reporting operations
- Manages report data retrieval
- Executes custom reporting statements

2. User interactions:
- Retrieves individual reports
- Accesses all available reports
- Executes custom report queries

3. Data handling:
- Works with Reporting beans
- Processes SQL/query statements
- Returns results as HashMaps
- Manages report data collections

4. Business rules:
- Must handle report execution safely
- Should validate reporting statements
- Needs to manage report data integrity

5. Dependencies:
- Uses Reporting bean
- Handles HashMap result sets
- Part of the core reporting infrastructure

Each interface represents a distinct aspect of the system's data access layer, with clear separation of concerns between customer management, UI text handling, and reporting functionality. The implementations would need to ensure thread safety, proper error handling, and data validation.
