# Requirements Analysis: cuco-core/src/main/java/at/a1ta/cuco/core/shared/dto/UserShopAssignment.java

UserShopAssignment.java
1. Purpose and functionality:
- Represents the assignment relationship between a user and a shop
- Simple DTO (Data Transfer Object) for mapping users to specific shops
- Implements Serializable for data transfer/persistence

2. User interactions:
- No direct user interactions - used internally for user-shop mapping

3. Data handling:
- Stores two string fields: userName and shopID
- Provides default constructor initializing empty strings
- Includes parameterized constructor and getter/setter methods

4. Business rules:
- Requires both userName and shopID to create valid assignment
- Values cannot be null (defaults to empty strings)

5. Dependencies:
- Implements java.io.Serializable
- Used by shop management and user management systems
