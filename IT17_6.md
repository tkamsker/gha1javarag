Iteration 17.6 

improve step4  

We expect that new_run.sh is run and output files and weaviate is avail for delivering the content. 

now we need to follow that proposal to use crew ai to generate good requirements for humans in MD format 

 CrewAI (multi-agent crews with roles/goals, good DX)

What it is: A multi-agent framework with roles, tools, knowledge, memory, and observability; supports Ollama via LiteLLM/other connectors.

Strengths:
Quick to stand up “specialist team” patterns; guardrails/telemetry built-in.
Documented paths to run with Ollama locally.

Weaknesses / Risks:
Community posts note practical quirks (e.g., Ollama context limits unless tuned). 
CrewAI
+1

Best use here: Fast PoC: Code Analyst, Build/Dependency Analyst, UI Flow Mapper, and Technical Writer “crew.”
Chance: Speed to value; easier for your team to iterate.
Risk: Autonomy loops if tools aren’t tightly scoped.

Implemented the CrewAI multi-agent requirements generation for IT17_6.
**Summary of Changes**
1. Added CrewAI dependency (requirements.txt)
    Added crewai==0.203.1 for multi-agent orchestration
    Compatible with Ollama for local LLM usage

2. Created CrewAI module (src/synth/crewai_requirements.py)
    WeaviateSearchTool: searches Weaviate for code artifacts
    Four agents:
        Code Analyst: backend components, architecture, data flow
        Dependency Analyst: dependencies, build config, integrations
        UI Flow Mapper: forms, navigation, frontend interactions
        Technical Writer: writes structured requirements

3. Integrated into CLI (src/cli.py)
    Added --use-crewai to the requirements command
    Selects CrewAI or the original per-artifact generation

4. Updated step4 (step4_requirements.sh)
    Uses CrewAI agents by default
    Added multi-agent workflow documentation

5. Created test script (test_crewai_requirements.py)

Verifies the implementation

**How It Works*+

Code Analyst searches Weaviate and analyzes backend components and patterns.
Dependency Analyst identifies dependencies, build config, and integrations.
UI Flow Mapper maps forms, navigation, and user interactions.
Technical Writer synthesizes everything into a structured markdown document.

**Usage**

# Generate requirements using CrewAI
./step4_requirements.sh

# Or via CLI
python main.py requirements --project YOUR_PROJECT --use-crewai

This setup lets each agent focus on its domain and coordinate to produce requirements and traceability.
Ready for testing.
