# Project Structure Rules

## Package Layout
- Follow the recommended structure from iteration15-2.md
- Use `src/` as the main package directory
- Separate parsers into individual modules by file type
- Keep CLI and main execution scripts in `src/`
- Place tests in `tests/` with unit/integration/golden subdirectories

## File Naming
- Use snake_case for Python files
- Use descriptive names that match functionality
- Parser files should be named by target file type (java_parser.py, jsp_parser.py, etc.)
- CLI module should be `cli.py`
- Main execution scripts in `scripts/` directory

## Import Organization
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local imports
- Use absolute imports within the package
- Keep imports at the top of files
