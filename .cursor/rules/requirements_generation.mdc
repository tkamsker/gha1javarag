# Requirements Generation Rules

## Template Structure
- Use the exact template from iteration15-2.md for each section
- Generate separate requirements docs for each architectural layer
- Group by: Database, Backend, Presentation/UI
- Create per-project requirements in OUTPUT_DIR/requirements/{project}/
- Generate master requirements file at OUTPUT_DIR/requirements/_master.md

## Content Organization
- Overview: Brief purpose within the application
- Components: List of classes/files/directories
- Functionality: Main features, inputs/outputs, key methods
- Dependencies: Other sections or external systems
- Notes: Legacy code, known issues, business rule nuances

## Cross-Linking
- Link dependencies between architectural layers
- Reference related components and files
- Include modernization hints where applicable
- Maintain traceability from code to requirements

## Output Format
- Use Markdown format for all requirements documents
- Include clear section headers and bullet points
- Use consistent formatting across all generated docs
- Include project context and file references
