Here are 8 efficient approaches to build a Java source code RAG system with API access, optimized for speed and cost:
Approach	Description	Pros	Cons	Strengths	Weaknesses
1. LangChain + Py4J	Use Py4J to interface with Java parsing tools, then process text chunks with LangChain RAG	Tight Java integration, preserves code structure	Complex JVM dependency management	Native Java AST parsing	Requires JVM runtime environment

2. Text-Based RAG	Treat Java files as plain text, chunk with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter	Simplest implementation, no code analysis	Loses syntax/context	Fast implementation (~1hr setup)	Poor semantic understanding of code 

3. Tree-sitter AST	Parse code with Python Tree-sitter, embed AST segments	Semantic code understanding	Requires parser setup	Context-aware retrieval	Additional preprocessing steps 

4. CodeBERT Embeddings	Use HuggingFace's CodeBERT model for code-specific embeddings	Specialized for code semantics	Large model size (400MB+)	Better than generic text embeddings	GPU recommended for speed 

5. LlamaIndex + Javalang	Parse with Javalang Python library, index with LlamaIndex	Lightweight pure-Python parser	Limited to Java 8 syntax	No JVM required	Doesn't handle modern Java features

6. Haystack+OpenNLP	Use OpenNLP for code analysis in Haystack pipeline	NLP-powered code processing	Overkill for simple use cases	Entity recognition in code	Complex Docker setup

7. ChromaDB+Transformers	Directly embed code with sentence-transformers	Minimal dependencies	No code parsing	1-file implementation	Treats code as generic text

8. GPT-4 Turbo+Faiss	Use OpenAI embeddings with local Faiss index	Best quality results	Ongoing API costs	Handles code nuances	$0.01/1k tokens cost

Fastest Implementation: Approach #2 (Text-Based) can be operational in <1 hour using:
python
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

loader = DirectoryLoader('src/main/java', glob="**/*.java")
docs = loader.load()
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=2000)
chunks = splitter.split_documents(docs)  # [4]

**Cheapest Hosting: Combine free tiers:**
1. Vector DB: ChromaDB (Local/Embedded)
2. API: FastAPI on AWS Lambda (1M free reqs/month)
3.Embeddings: All-MiniLM-L6-v2 (CPU-only)
3. LLM: LiteLLM proxy to Groq (8k tokens/$0.27) 

**Recommended Stack: For balance of cost and code understanding:**
1. Parse with Tree-sitter-python (Java grammar)
2. Embed with CodeBERT
3. Store in Qdrant Cloud Free Tier
4. Serve via FastAPI + Uvicorn on $5 DigitalOcean droplet

This solution handles ~50k LOC Java projects for <$10/month while maintaining code context awareness through AST parsing.
