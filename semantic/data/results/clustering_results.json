  "requirements": {
    "4": "Requirement: The system shall provide a mechanism to establish a connection to the database by including a static method named initializeDatabase within the DatabaseConnection class (located in the Database package). When invoked, this method must reliably create and return a valid Connection object to support database operations. Specifically, the method is responsible for:\n\n\u2022 Initiating and establishing a connection to the designated database.\n\u2022 Handling any exceptions or errors that may occur during the connection process.\n\u2022 Ensuring the connection is properly configured and ready for immediate use in subsequent database transactions.\n\nThis functionality is critical for the application to perform data operations effectively, and its behavior should be verifiable through appropriate testing procedures.",
    "2": "Requirement: The system\u2019s controller components that manage user and entity registration (specifically for doctors, patients, administrators, receptionists, workers, and generic users) shall each maintain an integer variable named \u201ci.\u201d This variable shall serve as an internal counter or index to track the number of additions or registrations made by that controller. In particular, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. For each controller class\u2014namely, AddDoctor, UserRegister, AddPatient, AdminRegister, AddRecp, and AddWorker\u2014the system code must declare an integer field named \u201ci.\u201d\n\n2. The variable \u201ci\u201d must be used consistently within its controller to support functions such as:\n\u2003\u2003a. Counting the number of entities (e.g., newly registered doctors, patients, etc.).\n\u2003\u2003b. Serving as an index or counter for managing the registration process.\n\u2003\u2003c. Potentially generating unique identifiers or tracking the state of registration operations.\n\n3. Though the exact initialization and usage details of \u201ci\u201d may depend on the specific needs of each registration process, its presence is mandatory across all registration-related controllers to facilitate uniform tracking and internal referencing.\n\n4. Future documentation and design specifications shall clearly define the intended semantics, lifecycle, and value management (such as initialization and incrementation rules) for the \u201ci\u201d variable in each controller class to ensure consistency and maintainability within the application.\n\nThis requirement ensures that all user and entity registration controllers follow a standardized approach to counting and indexing, thereby supporting reliable tracking and management of registration operations within the system.",
    "1": "Requirement: The system must expose a set of HTTP POST endpoints that enable the following functionalities for managing healthcare facility users and records:\n\n1. User and Administrator Authentication and Registration:\n   - Enable user registration and login operations that allow new users to create accounts (handled by the UserRegister and UserLogin controllers) and existing users to authenticate.\n   - Provide administrator registration and login endpoints (handled by the AdminRegister and AdminLogin controllers) to securely onboard and authenticate admin users.\n\n2. Entity Creation (Addition):\n   - Allow the creation of various healthcare facility personnel records by accepting HTTP POST requests:\n     \u2022 Add new doctors (handled by the AddDoctor controller).\n     \u2022 Add new patients (handled by the AddPatient controller).\n     \u2022 Add new receptionists (handled by the AddRecp controller).\n     \u2022 Add new workers (handled by the AddWorker controller).\n\n3. Record Update:\n   - Provide functionality to update the information of existing patients (handled by the updatePatient controller).\n\nEach of these functionalities must be implemented through a dedicated POST method (doPost) in the respective controller classes, ensuring that all create, update, and authentication operations are performed in a secure and efficient manner, and that the application appropriately distinguishes between different user roles and actions.",
    "3": "Requirement: The system shall provide a robust user authentication module that supports both regular user and administrator interactions. Specifically, the module must include the following functionalities:\n\n1. User Registration:\n   - A dedicated component (Controller.UserRegister) must allow new users to register.\n   - This component shall include a string attribute named \"user\" to capture the username provided by the registering user.\n\n2. User Login:\n   - A dedicated component (Controller.UserLogin) must enable existing users to authenticate themselves.\n   - This component shall include a string attribute named \"user\" to capture the username used for login.\n\n3. Administrator Login:\n   - A dedicated component (Controller.AdminLogin) must enable administrator-level users to authenticate.\n   - This component shall include a string attribute named \"user\" to capture the administrator\u2019s username.\n\nAcross all these components, the \"user\" attribute must be consistently defined as a String. This consistency ensures uniform handling of the username across registration and login processes, aiding in the integration of further validation and security controls.",
    "0": "Requirement: The system shall provide secure user and administrator account management by supporting distinct workflows for user registration, user login, and administrator login, each of which requires the input of a password. Specifically:\n\n\u2022 During user registration (via the UserRegister controller), the system shall require the user to supply a password (\"pass\") that meets predefined validation criteria (e.g., length, complexity) and ensure that it is processed and stored securely.\n\n\u2022 During the login processes for both standard users (UserLogin controller) and administrators (AdminLogin controller), the system shall require the entry of a password (\"pass\") and verify it against securely stored credentials to authenticate the user.\n\n\u2022 In all cases, the handling of the password field (\"pass\") must adhere to robust security practices, ensuring that it is transmitted securely (e.g., via encryption) and stored in a manner that prevents unauthorized access (e.g., hashed and salted).\n\nThis requirement ensures that password management is consistently and securely implemented across the user registration and authentication processes for both regular users and administrators."
