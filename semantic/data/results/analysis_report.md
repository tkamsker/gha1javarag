## Cluster Details

### Cluster 4
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system shall provide a static utility method to initialize and return a database connection. Specifically, within the Database module’s DatabaseConnection class, the system must implement a method named initializeDatabase that establishes a connection to the database and returns a valid Connection object. The method should ensure that the connection is properly configured and available for use by other components of the system to perform database operations. Additionally, the implementation must handle any initialization errors appropriately (e.g., by throwing exceptions or using logging mechanisms) to guarantee reliable and consistent access to the database throughout the application’s lifecycle.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Database::DatabaseConnection
- initializeDatabase
  - Description: initializeDatabase()
  - Definition: static Connection Database.DatabaseConnection.initializeDatabase

### Cluster 2
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system shall provide a Controller layer that supports the addition and registration of various user and system entities—including doctors, patients, administrators, receptionists, users, and workers—through dedicated controller classes. Each of these controller classes (namely, AddDoctor, UserRegister, AddPatient, AdminRegister, AddRecp, and AddWorker) must include and manage an integer attribute (named "i") that serves as a counter or unique identifier for the respective entity’s registration process. The attribute “i” shall be used to track the number of addition operations or to assign unique, sequential numeric identifiers to newly registered entities, ensuring that:

1. Every registration or addition event in these controllers is captured via an internally maintained counter.
2. Unique identification or orderly processing is guaranteed for every entity added by the system.
3. The system maintains consistency and integrity in the creation and management of records across different entity types.

This requirement ensures that the Controller layer uniformly handles the addition of new entities, leverages the "i" variable to maintain order and uniqueness, and forms a fundamental part of the system’s registration and data integrity process.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Controller::AddDoctor
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AddDoctor.i

#### Controller::UserRegister
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.UserRegister.i

#### Controller::AddPatient
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AddPatient.i

#### Controller::AdminRegister
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AdminRegister.i

#### Controller::AddRecp
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AddRecp.i

#### Controller::AddWorker
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AddWorker.i

### Cluster 1
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system shall provide a set of HTTP POST interfaces—implemented as dedicated Controller classes—for managing user interactions and administrative operations in a healthcare management application. Specifically, the system must allow the following:

• Doctor Management: The system must support the addition of new doctors via a dedicated endpoint (AddDoctor.doPost), handling all necessary validations and data persistence.

• Patient Management: The system must support both the creation (AddPatient.doPost) and updating (updatePatient.doPost) of patient records through secure POST operations.

• User Account Management: The system must provide endpoints for user registration (UserRegister.doPost) and user login (UserLogin.doPost), ensuring that proper authentication and validation protocols are followed.

• Administrator Management: The system must include separate endpoints for administrator registration (AdminRegister.doPost) and administrator login (AdminLogin.doPost), guaranteeing enhanced security measures for administrative access.

• Additional Staff Management: The system must support the addition of receptionists (AddRecp.doPost) and other workers (AddWorker.doPost) through their respective endpoints, managing the onboarding and data management process.

Overall, all these operations must be implemented through HTTP POST requests to maintain proper data encapsulation, security, and modularity of the application.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Controller::AddDoctor
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AddDoctor.doPost

#### Controller::UserRegister
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.UserRegister.doPost

#### Controller::UserLogin
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.UserLogin.doPost

#### Controller::AddPatient
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AddPatient.doPost

#### Controller::AdminLogin
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AdminLogin.doPost

#### Controller::AdminRegister
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AdminRegister.doPost

#### Controller::AddRecp
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AddRecp.doPost

#### Controller::updatePatient
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.updatePatient.doPost

#### Controller::AddWorker
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AddWorker.doPost

### Cluster 3
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system shall support secure and consistent user identification across registration and login functionalities for both regular users and administrators. Specifically, the following conditions must be met:

1. When a new user registers through the UserRegister controller, the controller must include a String field named "user" to hold the identifier (e.g., username) of the registering user.

2. During a user login process handled by the UserLogin controller, the controller must include a String field named "user" to capture and process the login identifier of the user attempting access.

3. For administrative login through the AdminLogin controller, a String field named "user" must be present to uniquely identify the administrator attempting to log in.

These implementations ensure consistent naming conventions and data types across the controllers, thereby facilitating proper verification, authentication, and role-based access control within the system.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Controller::UserRegister
- user
  - Description: user
  - Definition: String Controller.UserRegister.user

#### Controller::UserLogin
- user
  - Description: user
  - Definition: String Controller.UserLogin.user

#### Controller::AdminLogin
- user
  - Description: user
  - Definition: String Controller.AdminLogin.user

### Cluster 0
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system shall support password-based authentication for both regular users and administrators. Specifically, for each of the authentication-related functions—user registration, user login, and admin login—the system must include a password field represented as a string. This means:

• The UserRegister component must include a string variable (named “pass”) to capture and process the password during user registration.  
• The UserLogin component must include a string variable (named “pass”) to capture and verify the password entered during a user login attempt.  
• The AdminLogin component must include a string variable (named “pass”) to capture and verify the password entered by an administrator during an admin login attempt.

By defining a clear, consistent “pass” attribute in each controller, the design ensures that all user credentials (both for registration and login purposes) are handled uniformly, facilitating reliable authentication processes across both user and administrative pathways.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Controller::UserRegister
- pass
  - Description: pass
  - Definition: String Controller.UserRegister.pass

#### Controller::UserLogin
- pass
  - Description: pass
  - Definition: String Controller.UserLogin.pass

#### Controller::AdminLogin
- pass
  - Description: pass
  - Definition: String Controller.AdminLogin.pass
