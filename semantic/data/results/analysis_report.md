## Cluster Details

### Cluster 4
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system shall be capable of establishing a connection to its persistent storage (database) through a dedicated method. Specifically, the Database module must include a class named DatabaseConnection that provides a public static method called initializeDatabase. This method shall return a Connection object representing an active connection to the designated database. The implementation must ensure that all necessary connection parameters are configured appropriately, allowing the system to reliably and securely interact with the database.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Database::DatabaseConnection
- initializeDatabase
  - Description: initializeDatabase()
  - Definition: static Connection Database.DatabaseConnection.initializeDatabase

### Cluster 2
**Requirement:** Requirement: 
The system shall support the registration and addition of various user roles by implementing dedicated controller classes for each role. Specifically, the system must provide the following controllers:
 • AddDoctor – to handle doctor registration,
 • AddPatient – to handle patient registration,
 • AdminRegister – to handle administrative user registration,
 • AddRecp – to handle receptionist registration,
 • AddWorker – to handle general worker registration,
 • UserRegister – to handle overall user registration.

Each of these controller classes must include an integer variable named “i” that serves as an internal counter or identifier within its respective module. This variable “i” shall be used consistently across all controllers for tasks such as tracking state, counting processed records, or maintaining unique identifiers as needed by the business logic. The implementation must ensure that the handling of “i” is correct, consistent, and supports the intended functionality (such as sequential record numbering, control flow management, or logging) within each controller module.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Controller::AddDoctor
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AddDoctor.i

#### Controller::UserRegister
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.UserRegister.i

#### Controller::AddPatient
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AddPatient.i

#### Controller::AdminRegister
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AdminRegister.i

#### Controller::AddRecp
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AddRecp.i

#### Controller::AddWorker
- i
  - Description: i
  - Definition: int Controller.AddWorker.i

### Cluster 1
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system shall support a web-based management platform for various user roles in a healthcare or similar organization by handling HTTP POST requests to perform data insertion, updates, registration, and authentication actions. In particular, the system must:

1. Process and record the registration of different user types:
   - Doctors (via AddDoctor)
   - Patients (via AddPatient)
   - Receptionists (via AddRecp)
   - Workers (via AddWorker)
   - Administrators (via AdminRegister)
   - General users (via UserRegister)

2. Facilitate secure and reliable user authentication:
   - Enable user login (via UserLogin)
   - Enable administrator login (via AdminLogin)

3. Support the updating of patient data:
   - Allow modifications to patient records (via updatePatient)

4. Acquire input reliably via HTTP POST requests:
   - Each controller’s doPost method is responsible for handling and processing forms of data sent by clients, ensuring data is valid, appropriately stored in the persistence layer (e.g., databases), and consistent with business logic.

5. Provide an extensible and modular controller-based architecture:
   - Each functionality (registration, login, addition, update) is encapsulated in its respective controller, promoting maintainability, separation of concerns, and scalability of the system.

Overall, the system is required to integrate these functionalities to support comprehensive user management, including registration, authentication, and data updates across multiple roles while ensuring secure server-side processing of POST requests.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Controller::AddDoctor
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AddDoctor.doPost

#### Controller::UserRegister
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.UserRegister.doPost

#### Controller::UserLogin
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.UserLogin.doPost

#### Controller::AddPatient
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AddPatient.doPost

#### Controller::AdminLogin
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AdminLogin.doPost

#### Controller::AdminRegister
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AdminRegister.doPost

#### Controller::AddRecp
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AddRecp.doPost

#### Controller::updatePatient
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.updatePatient.doPost

#### Controller::AddWorker
- doPost
  - Description: doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
  - Definition: void Controller.AddWorker.doPost

### Cluster 3
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system shall support user account management by providing separate interfaces for user registration, user login, and administrator login. In each of these controllers (UserRegister, UserLogin, and AdminLogin), a user identifier – represented as a String variable named "user" – shall be used to capture and process the username information input by the end user. Specifically, the system must:

1. Allow new users to register by capturing a username (via the Controller.UserRegister.user property).
2. Enable registered users to log in using their username (via the Controller.UserLogin.user property).
3. Provide a dedicated login mechanism for administrators using their username (via the Controller.AdminLogin.user property).

This design ensures a consistent approach to handling user identity across different authentication processes within the system.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Controller::UserRegister
- user
  - Description: user
  - Definition: String Controller.UserRegister.user

#### Controller::UserLogin
- user
  - Description: user
  - Definition: String Controller.UserLogin.user

#### Controller::AdminLogin
- user
  - Description: user
  - Definition: String Controller.AdminLogin.user

### Cluster 0
**Requirement:** Requirement: The system SHALL provide secure authentication support for user registration and login—both for regular users and administrators—by including a standardized password attribute. Specifically:

• Each of the controllers handling authentication (UserRegister, UserLogin, and AdminLogin) MUST define a string attribute (named “pass”) to capture the password input provided by the user or administrator.

• The “pass” field in each controller SHALL be used as a key element in the authentication process, ensuring that the password is correctly received, processed, and subsequently validated against stored credentials.

• The design and implementation of these password attributes MUST adhere to security best practices (e.g., input validation, proper encryption or hashing at a later stage, secure storage, etc.) to mitigate risks associated with handling sensitive credential data.

This requirement ensures that all aspects of the user and administrator authentication workflow are consistently and securely managed through a dedicated password field in each relevant controller.

**Classes and Methods:**

#### Controller::UserRegister
- pass
  - Description: pass
  - Definition: String Controller.UserRegister.pass

#### Controller::UserLogin
- pass
  - Description: pass
  - Definition: String Controller.UserLogin.pass

#### Controller::AdminLogin
- pass
  - Description: pass
  - Definition: String Controller.AdminLogin.pass
