You're absolutely right! There's an inconsistency between the hardcoded models in the scripts and the `.env` configuration. Let me fix this to ensure all code uses the models from `.env`.

First, let me check what's currently in the `.env` file:


[1 tool called]

Let me check if there's a `.env` file or create one with the proper model configuration:


[2 tools called]

Let me check the content using cat:


[1 tool called]

Perfect! I can see the issue. The `.env` file has `OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME=llama3.1:8b` and `OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL_NAME=nomic-embed-text`, but the scripts are hardcoded to use `llama3.2:3b`. Let me fix this by updating all scripts and code to use the models from `.env`.

First, let me update the settings to properly load the Ollama models:


[1 tool called]

Good! The settings are already configured to use the models from `.env`. Now let me update the `step1_setup.sh` script to use the models from the settings instead of hardcoded values:


[1 tool called]

Now let me also update the Weaviate client to use the embedding model from settings. Let me check if there's a way to configure the embedding model in Weaviate:


[1 tool called]

Now I need to add the moduleConfig to all the other classes. Let me do this systematically:


[1 tool called]

Now let me check if there are any other places in the code that use hardcoded model names. Let me search for any hardcoded references:


[1 tool called]

Good! The only reference is in the settings file as a default value, which is correct. Now let me check if there are any other hardcoded model references in the scripts:


[1 tool called]

Let me update the `run_iteration17b.sh` script to also use the models from `.env`:


[1 tool called]

Now let me check if there are any other hardcoded model references in the codebase:


[1 tool called]

Perfect! Now let me check if there are any other places where models are used. Let me also check the chunking module to make sure it uses the correct model:


[1 tool called]

Let me check the embedding function to see if it uses the correct model:


[1 tool called]

Great! The chunking module is already using `settings.ollama_embed_model_name`. Now let me check if there are any other places that might use hardcoded models. Let me also check the synthesis module:


[1 tool called]

Perfect! The synthesis module is also using `settings.ollama_model_name`. Now let me update the todo list and create a summary of what I've fixed:


[1 tool called]

Now let me test the updated step1_setup.sh script to make sure it correctly reads the models from .env:


[1 tool called]

Perfect! Now let me create a summary document of all the changes I made:

## ‚úÖ **Model Consistency Fix Complete!**

I've successfully fixed the inconsistency between hardcoded models and `.env` configuration. Here's what I changed:

### üîß **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Updated `step1_setup.sh`**:
   - ‚ùå **Before**: Hardcoded `llama3.2:3b` and `nomic-embed-text`
   - ‚úÖ **After**: Reads models from `.env` using Python settings
   - Now dynamically pulls the correct models: `llama3.1:8b` and `nomic-embed-text`

2. **Enhanced `src/store/weaviate_client.py`**:
   - Added `moduleConfig` to all Weaviate classes
   - Now uses `settings.ollama_embed_model_name` and `settings.ollama_base_url`
   - Ensures Weaviate uses the correct embedding model for vectorization

3. **Updated `run_iteration17b.sh`**:
   - Removed hardcoded model references
   - Now shows generic placeholder for model names

4. **Verified Existing Code**:
   - ‚úÖ Chunking module already uses `settings.ollama_embed_model_name`
   - ‚úÖ Synthesis module already uses `settings.ollama_model_name`
   - ‚úÖ Settings module properly configured

### üìã **Current Configuration:**
```bash
# From .env file
OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME=llama3.1:8b
OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL_NAME=nomic-embed-text
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

### üöÄ **Benefits:**
- **Single Source of Truth**: All models come from `.env`
- **Easy Configuration**: Change models by updating `.env`
- **Consistency**: No more hardcoded model references
- **Flexibility**: Different environments can use different models

### üß™ **Test the Fix:**
```bash
# Check current configuration
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.append(str(Path('.').absolute() / 'src'))
from config.settings import settings
print(f'Main model: {settings.ollama_model_name}')
print(f'Embed model: {settings.ollama_embed_model_name}')
"
```

Now all your scripts and code will consistently use the models specified in your `.env` file! üéâ
